  <h1>New Inducements</h1>

<p>Blood Bowl is a sport that has captured the hearts and minds of an entire world. It is played from pole to pole, across many continents and in every climate imaginable. There are far more rules variations than can easily be covered within a single tome, and no end of ideas to explore in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to the common Inducements listed in the <em>Blood Bowl</em> rulebook, coaches may wish to use the ones detailed on the following pages. All of the Inducements that follow are balanced for use alongside the common Inducements, but are listed as optional extras so that the list of Inducements isn't too long and confusing.</p>
<p>The inclusion of these rules in a league or tournament is at the discretion of the league commissioner or tournament organiser. Otherwise, coaches who wish to use these rules for an exhibition game should decide this between themselves.</p>
<h2 id="0-2-infamous-coaching-staff">0-2 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF</h2>
<p><strong>PRICE VARIES, AVAILABLE TO VARIOUS TEAMS</strong></p>
<p>Although most Blood Bowl celebrities are players, with the occasional ref thrown in for good measure, there are several well-known members of coaching staff around the circuit. From choreography directors for the cheerleading squad, to financial specialists who will deal with bribing the officials, there is almost no limit to the helpful hangers-on that linger around Blood Bowl stadia, hoping to find employment with a coach daft enough to believe their claims. Consequently, many a team will experiment with all manner of temporary coaching staff, hoping to get something useful from the deal.</p>
<p>However, and perhaps contrary to expectations, some of these specialist experts do actually have some useful knowledge to impart or skills to share. Many of these individuals have become minor celebrities in their own right in recent years, becoming regular interviewees on Cabalvision! Though it must be said, most such interviews only happen when the players themselves are refusing to speak to the press...</p>
<p>(In)Famous Coaching Staff are available to purchase during the pre-game sequence at the cost listed. You may purchase up to two (In)Famous Coaching Staff who are allowed to assist your team.</p>
<p>It is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named (In)Famous Coaching Staff:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the (In)Famous Coaching Staff but the (In)Famous Coaching Staff will keep both hiring fees.</li>
<li>If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the (In)Famous Coaching Staff one team has clearly hired a ringer!</li>

In addition, if her team cannot set up 11 players at the start of a drive, Kari may decide to <em>"show 'em how it's done!".</em> Her team's coach can choose to set her up as part of the team. If they do so, she counts as part of the team for the duration of the drive, and no longer counts as two Temp Agency Cheerleaders. When the drive ends, Kari is Sent-off. You cannot Argue the Call or use a Bribe to prevent this. She will play no further part in the game she does not count as any Temp Agency Cheerleaders, and she cannot be used in a later drive.</p>

<h2 id="0-1-wizard">0-1 WIZARD</h2>
<p><strong>PRICE VARIES, AVAILABLE TO VARIOUS TEAMS</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, Wizards in Blood Bowl have brought sports viewers more joy than almost any other form of outside interference, and the fans never tire of seeing their favourite stars turned into hopping amphibians or sticks of charcoal. It's hilarious!</p>
<p>Wizards, just like everybody else in the known world, are keen sports fans and many are fanatically loyal in support of their chosen team. It is hardly surprising that, in the early days of Blood Bowl, Wizards of all stripes would 'help out' the team they supported with carefully- selected spells. Soon, games were awash with magic as rival Wizards battled to give their team the edge. In the end, the Colleges of Magic were forced to step in at the NAF's request and insist that in order to have magical aid teams must have purchased, at an exorbitant fee to cover admin costs and handling, a special permit from the new governing body for such things (the Colleges of Magic, as it turned out). They limited this aid to one spell per match, and even this had to be chosen from a very limited spellbook and cast by an officially-appointed Colleges of Magic Sports-Wizard, whom in turn had to have a special license from the new governing body for such things (that's right, the Colleges of Magic!). Wizards and fans alike soon realised that what they really wanted to see was a proper Blood Bowl match rather than a spellcasting contest, so the new rules were soon universally accepted.</p>
<p>Today, Wizards of all types are drawn to Blood Bowl stadia on game day. From those belonging to the Arcane Colleges, to powerful Elven mages, Sorcerers and Shamans of Chaos, and even, in rare circumstances, the near-mythical Slann Mage-priests of Lustria. All find ready employment with the many Cabalvision networks, as it takes huge amounts of magical energy to capture the action and beam it globally to the crystal balls and magic mirrors of Cabalvision subscribers around the world.</p>
<p>Consequently, there are always Wizards to be found at any given fixture, card-carrying members of the Colleges of Magic, all more than happy to moonlight for a team wishing to secure their assistance.</p>
<p>No team may purchase more than one Wizard Inducement per game.</p>
<p>Some Wizards are named, although most are not. It is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named Wizard:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the named Wizard but the named Wizard will keep both hiring fees.</li>
<li>If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the named Wizard one team has clearly hired a ringer!</li>
</ul>
<p>If a Wizard Inducement is not named, there is no restriction on both teams fielding the same type.</p>

<p><strong>200,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE <a href="../../core_rules/the_teams/#lustrian-superleague">LUSTRIAN SUPERLEAGUE</a> SPECIAL RULE</strong></p>
<p>Once per game, a Slann Mage-priest may cast one of the following spells:</p>
<p><strong>TEMPORAL DISTORTION</strong></p>
<p>You may cast this spell immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Magical energy fills the stadium, causing the passage of time to slow down or speed up as the Mage-priest wishes.</p>
<p>You may attempt to move both teams' turn markers forwards or backwards one space, effectively causing both teams to gain an extra turn this half or lose one of the remaining turns. Both turn markers must move in the same direction. Declare whether you wish to move the turn markers forwards one space or backwards one space and roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 5+, the spell is successful and the turn markers are moved.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1-4, the stadium fills with light and the strangely localised effects cause the Mage-priest to suddenly develop a few more warts and wrinkles, but otherwise the spell has no effect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TECTONIC SHIFT</strong></p>
<p>You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated. For the duration of this team turn, there is a -1 modifier applied to the dice roll every time an opposition player attempts to Rush.</p>

<ul>
<li>On a roll of 3+, these two players immediately switch places.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1 or 2, the players become slightly transparent as they waver between realities! Until the start of your next team turn, these two players lose their Tackle Zone and gain the No Hands trait.</li>

<h2 id="biased-referee-inducements">BIASED REFEREE INDUCEMENTS</h2>
<p>In general, the members of the RARG that officiate over Blood Bowl games are unsung heroes of the sport. However, many referees have risen to the ranks of superstardom for their dedication to the rules, if not for their dedication to fair play! Whilst bribery is an established part of the culture of Blood Bowl (the RARG even dictates set rates and offers discounts for repeat, there are many referees willing to go the extra yard for a team with gold to share.</p>
<p>Biased Referees are available to purchase during the pre-game sequence at the cost listed, and because Blood Bowl games tend to be officiated over by a group rather than a single individual, both teams may purchase a Biased Referee. You may purchase one Biased Referee to treat your team favourably during the game ahead.</p>
<p>For the most part, a Biased Referee will treat both teams equally, meaning that they follow all of the normal referee rules as described in the <em>Blood Bowl</em> rulebook. Where they differ is that they will be either far more harsh in their scrutiny of the opposition or far more lenient in their treatment of the team that has paid them off. How this manifests is described in each Biased Referee's description.</p>
<p>Most Biased Referees are named, although some are not. As with Star Players, it is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named Biased Referee:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the named Biased Referee but the named Biased Referee will keep both hiring fees.</li>
<li>If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the named Biased Referee they can dish out harsh rulings to both sides!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>'RED' CARD</strong></p>
<p>When suitably remunerated, Ranulf will keep a particularly close eye on one of the teams. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 4+, Ranulf loudly demands that play halt whilst he investigates further.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the ref's attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once spotted by Ranulf in this way (and only in this way), the coach of the player that committed the Foul must choose one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>The coach may use a Bribe if one is available.</li>
<li>The player that committed the Foul may accept their fate and be Sent-off.</li>
<li>The player may attempt to argue with Ranulf! Ranulf will settle the argument with his axe. An Armour roll is made against the player, applying a +2 modifier to the result:</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;- If the roll is higher than the Armour Value of the player, they become Prone and an Injury roll is made against them. The player is not Sent-off and no Turnover is caused.</p>
<p>&emsp;- If the roll is equal to or lower than the Armour Value of the player hit, the attack has no effect. The player is Sent-off and a Turnover caused.</p>
<p><strong>"I'M NOT ONE FOR ARGUING!"</strong></p>

<p><strong>STRICT DISCIPLINE</strong></p>
<p>Korensson is renowned for bringing strict discipline to the pitch which, when questioned, is backed up with extremely tough penalties. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 4+, Korensson has spotted the violation.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the ref's attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once spotted by Korensson in this way (and only in this way), the player that committed the Foul is immediately Sent-off. When a player is Sent-off in this way, their coach cannot use a Bribe but may attempt to Argue the Call. However, if a 1 is rolled on the Argue the Call table, not only is the player and the coach Sent-off, but one other randomly selected player belonging to the opposing team and that is currently on the pitch is Sent-off as well.</p>
<p><strong>"SIT DOWN AND KEEP QUIET!"</strong></p>
<p>If a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, roll again it takes a particularly riled-up crowd to want to advance on Korensson.</p>

<p><strong>JORM DOESN'T LIKE CHEATERS!</strong></p>
<p>Jorm is always on the lookout for dirty play, and misses very little. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 4+, Jorm has spotted the cheat and rolls up his sleeves to deliver his own form of justice.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the ref's attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once spotted by Jorm in this way (and only in this way), the player that committed the Foul is immediately Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by Jorm, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.</p>
<p><strong>"SHUT IT, YOU HOOLIGANS!"</strong></p>
<p>If a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, the normal effects are ignored instead, Jorm goes into a rampage and starts tearing through the stands to teach the rowdy fans a lesson!

<p><strong>HEAVY-HANDED INCOMPETENCE</strong></p>
<p>The Trundlefoot Triplets often try their best to partake in a bit of honest corruption, but all too often they fail. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 5+, the player that committed the Foul is Sent-off, exactly as if they had rolled a double (i.e., the opposing coach may use a Bribe if one is available and may attempt to Argue the Call).</li>
<li>On a roll of 2-4, the triplets, squabbling amongst themselves, miss the Foul.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1, however, the victim of the Foul is Sent-off as if they had committed a Foul and rolled a double!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>"SMART PLAYERS ARE WELL-BEHAVED PLAYERS!"</strong></p>
<p>At the start of each drive, after both teams are set-up but before the kick-off, roll a D6. On a roll of 6, one randomly selected player on the opposing team that is not being Marked becomes embroiled in a pointless argument with the triplets about their kit. The player is immediately Placed Prone and becomes Stunned, representing the time wasted arguing.</p>
<p><strong>"THEY DON'T LOOK HAPPY!"</strong></p>
<p>If a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, the triplets make themselves scarce and will play no further part in this game. In addition, each team also gets a Bribe as normal.</p>
<h2 id="other-inducements">OTHER INDUCEMENTS</h2>
<p>As well as powerful Wizards, notorious referees and renowned sideline staff, Blood Bowl teams often employ a wide variety of other methods to gain the upper hand. Be it strong ale to build up the fighting spirits of smaller players, to catapults that launch projectiles across the pitch, there seems to be no limit to the ingenuity shown by teams unwilling to accept the role of underdog in an important fixture!</p>
<p><strong>INDUCEMENTS IN LEAGUE PLAY</strong></p>
<p>As described in the <em>Blood Bowl</em> rulebook, during the pre- game sequence of a league fixture, each team can spend gold pieces either from their Treasury, from Petty Cash or both, to purchase any of the Inducements available to them which are then recorded on the team's Game Record sheet.</p>
<p><strong>INDUCEMENTS IN EXHIBITION PLAY</strong></p>
<p>When a team is drafted for exhibition play, you may spend as much or as little of your Team Draft Budget as you wish on Inducements, provided your team contains the minimum of 11 players, not including Induced Star Players. If you are drafting a team for exhibition play to be used at an event or tournament, you should pay close attention to the rulespack created by the organisers, as it is quite common that not all Inducements will be allowed. Also, it is common for tournament organisers to create their own, special Inducements.</p>
<p>If two coaches are drafting teams for exhibition play between themselves, they should take a few minutes to discuss Inducements first. It is important to decide if there are any Inducements they feel should be included or any they would prefer to leave out.</p>

<p>During each Start of Drive sequence, after Step 2 but before Step 3, you can select a single player on your team that is currently on the pitch that does not have the Loner (X+) trait and choose one of the following runes. Then roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 4+, the rune takes effect, but you cannot attempt to use the Runesmith again at the start of a later drive.</li>
<li>On a roll of 2 or 3, the rune does not work, but you can attempt to use the Runesmith again at the start of a later drive.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1, the rune does not work, and you cannot attempt to use the Runesmith again at the start of a later drive.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0-1-halfling-hot-pot">0-1 HALFLING HOT POT</h3>
<p><strong>80,000 GOLD PIECES (60,000 GOLD PIECES FOR TEAMS WITH THE <a href="../../core_rules/the_teams/#halfling-thimble-cup">HALFLING THIMBLE CUP</a> SPECIAL RULE), AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE <a href="../../core_rules/the_teams/#halfling-thimble-cup">HALFLING THIMBLE CUP</a> OR <a href="../../core_rules/the_teams/#old-world-classic">OLD WORLD CLASSIC</a> SPECIAL RULES</strong></p>
<p>A Hot Pot can be used once per game, launching a cauldron of piping-hot stew onto the opposition. The Hot Pot may be used immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Choose a target square anywhere on the pitch and roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 6, the shot is on target.</li>
<li>On a roll of 2-5, the shot is off target the target square is moved D3 squares in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1, something has gone horribly wrong and the Hot Pot has misfired in the team dugout. D3 randomly selected players in the Reserves box immediately become KO'd and moved to the Knocked- out box.</li>
</ul>
<p>A player in the target square is automatically hit by the Hot Pot itself. If a Standing player is hit, they are Knocked Down. If a Prone or Stunned player is hit, an Armour roll is made against them. In either case, you may apply a +2 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.</p>
<p>Additionally, roll a D6 for each Standing player (from either team) that is in a square adjacent to the target square:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the mess of stew that showers out of the Hot Pot.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid being hit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any Standing player hit in this way is Placed Prone.</p>

<p>During Step 2 of every Start of Drive sequence, the Master of Ballistics can attempt to advise the kicker. After placing the ball but before rolling for deviation, roll a D3 on the table opposite:</p>
<p><strong>MASTER OF BALLISTICS</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>D3</th>
<th>Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><strong>Complete Misunderstanding:</strong> The kicker has rather missed the point, and the kick-off deviates as normal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><strong>Interesting Theory...</strong> The Master of Ballistics becomes side-tracked explaining the theory and runs out of time before the whistle. The distance the ball deviates is reduced by one square, from D6 squares to D6-1 squares (meaning there is a chance it won't deviate at all if a 1 is rolled).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><strong>Successful Practical Application:</strong> By Nuffle, the kicker's grasped it! After rolling the dice for deviation, the kicking team's coach can choose to modify the roll of either the D6 or the D8 by +1 or +2, or -1 or -2 as they wish, to a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 6 (for the D6) and 8 (for the D8).</td>

<p>At the start of a drive, after both teams have been set up but before the kick-off (between Step 1 and Step 2), randomly select D3 players with the Stunty trait that are currently set up on the pitch. For the remainder of this drive, those players gain the Dauntless and Frenzy skills and the Really Stupid (4+) trait.</p>

<p><strong>30,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM</strong></p>
<p>A team that includes a Team Mascot gains an extra team re-roll (a suitable model should be placed on your team re- roll tracker). However, to use the Team Mascot re-roll you must first roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 1-4, the Team Mascot proves ineffective and, pelted by food wrappers and worse, retreats to the locker room. The Team Mascot re-roll is lost for this half of the game. However, you may use a normal team re-roll instead.</li>
<li>On a roll of 5+, the Team Mascot re-roll can be used, just like a normal team re-roll.</li>
</ul>

<p>Should a player on your team be removed from play having suffered a 10-12, Serious Injury result on the Casualty table, after any other attempts to heal that player have been made and have failed, you may use this Inducement. The player is immediately removed from the Casualty box and placed in the Reserves box of your dugout, having been miraculously healed by the liberal application of something that smells extremely suspicious. However, at the end of this game, the result of the Casualty roll is applied as normal.</p>

<p>After Step 4, but before Step 5 of the pre-game sequence, you may place a bet of between 10,000 and 100,000 gold pieces that your team will win the game. Simply inform your opponent that the bet has been placed, and how much you are betting. Should your team win the game, you will receive double your stake back during Step 1 of the post-game sequence (for example, if you bet 20,000 gold pieces that your team would win, you will win 40,000 gold pieces if it does win).</p>
<p>If, however, your team loses, the stake is lost (such is the risk of gambling)!</p>
