Both teams have a Blitzer, who is good at blocking opposing players, and a Thrower who is good at picking up and throwing the ball. In addition, the Human team has a Catcher, who is more fragile but gets a free move if they catch a thrown ball.

Understanding how best to use your players' abilities is key to victory.</p>"},{"location":"blitz_bowl/rules/#important-concepts","title":"IMPORTANT CONCEPTS","text":"<p>Before we dive into how to play the game, here are a few important concepts you need to know:</p> <p>Coach: The real-life people who are playing this game</p> <p>Players: The plastic player models that makes up a coach's team</p> <p>Team-mate: A player from the same team</p> <p>Opponent: A player from the opposing coach's team</p>"},{"location":"blitz_bowl/rules/#throw-checks-and-armour-checks","title":"Throw Checks and Armour Checks","text":"<p>If a coach is called upon to make an Armour or Throw check for a player, roll a D6 and compare the result to the Throw or Armour value for that player. If the result is lower than the given value, the check fails; otherwise, the check succeeds.</p> <p>Some rules will modify the result of a check - this is done before comparing the dice result to the Throw or Armour value. However, in all cases, a check can never be modified by more than -1/+1, even when more than one modifier would apply. In addition, an unmodified roll of 1 on the dice always fails and an unmodified roll of 6 on the dice always succeeds.</p> <p>A player with a '-' for their Armour value automatically fails all Armour checks. A player with a '-' for their Throw value cannot take possession of the ball - if they move into a square containing the ball or a ball moves onto them it automatically bounces (see Bouncing Ball, page 12).</p> <p>Re-rolling Dice: Some rules allow a coach to 're-roll'. This lets the coach pick up the dice they just rolled and roll it again. If they rolled multiple dice, they must re-roll all of them. A re-roll cannot be used on the same dice roll more than once - you can't re-roll a re-roll! You also cannot use a re-roll on another coach's dice. If a coach re-rolls the dice, they must use the result of the re-roll, even if it is worse.</p> <p>Taking Possession of the Ball: A player will take possession of a ball when any of the following occur:</p> <ul> <li>They are the target of a successful Throw action or a hand-off</li> <li>They move into the same square as a ball whilst making a Run action</li> <li>A ball bounces into the square they occupy and they are Open</li> <li>Through a unique player ability or Bonus Play card ability</li> </ul> <p>The rules for these are covered later, but regardless of how a player takes possession of the ball, when they do, place the ball on the base for the model of that player. Many bases have holes in them for this purpose. Once this is done, that player is said to have possession of the ball.</p> <p>CHALLENGE CARDS: The front of each Challenge card shows the following information:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>The name of the Challenge</li> <li>The conditions that must be met for a coach to claim the Challenge card</li> <li>The points scored for claiming the card</li> </ol> <p>The back of each Challenge card is a Bonus Play and shows the following information:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>The name of the Bonus Play</li> <li>How the card can be played</li> </ol> <p>Card vs Rulebook: Some cards break the rules in this rulebook, for example by modifying a Throw check by more than -1 or +1. Whenever a card contradicts the rules in this book, the card takes precedence.</p> <p>Cannot: If two or more rules come into conflict, and one of them says 'cannot', that rule takes precedence. For example, if a player has a rule that says their Block actions cannot be assisted, a Bonus Play card that means your players' Block actions are assisted would have no effect on that player.</p> <p>A COACH'S HAND: When Challenge cards are claimed these cards are put to one side, or held by a coach. These cards are referred to in these rules as a coach's 'hand'. The Bonus Play side of the cards in a coach's hand should be kept secret from their opponent.</p> <p>IMMEDIATELY: When an ability or effect is described as happening immediately, it means before doing anything else, such as claiming a Challenge card, making another Action, or finishing the current turn.</p> <p>PLAYER STATUS: During a game of Blitz Bowl, players can either be Open, Marked, Prone or in the dugout. Each of these is explained below:</p> <p>Open Players - A player who is standing and who is not adjacent to any opponent is Open. Each of the eight squares around a given square are said to be adjacent to it.</p> <p>Marked Players - A player who is standing adjacent to an opponent who is not Prone, is Marked. A player can Mark, and be Marked by, multiple opponents at once. Marking has a number of effects in the game, which are explained later in the rules.</p> <p>Prone Players - A player who is laying on the ground is Prone. A Prone player cannot Mark another player and is for all intents and purposes not considered to be an active participant in the game. For example, they cannot be used to claim Challenge cards and do not affect the placement of players returning to the pitch (see Reserves, page 13). If a player has possession of the ball when they become Prone, the ball bounces from that player's square (see Bouncing Ball, page 12).</p> <p>Reserves Players - A player will sometimes be placed in their team's dugout - this represents the player waiting to return to the pitch.</p> <p>SCORING POINTS: Teams are awarded points during their turn by scoring touchdowns and claiming Challenge cards. Each team's score is recorded by the position of their score marker on the score track. Once a team's score reaches 10 points, their team coin is placed on the +10 space and their score marker is returned to 0. The same happens when their score reaches 20 or 30. So, for example, a team with a score of 17 would have their score marker on the 7 space and their coin on the + 10 space.</p>"},{"location":"blitz_bowl/rules/#game-overview_1","title":"GAME OVERVIEW","text":"<p>To setup a game of Blitz Bowl, follow the steps outlined below:</p> <ol> <li>First, flip one of the team coins to determine which coach wins the toss. The winning coach chooses the pitch they want to use and places the game board in the centre of the table with that side face up. If this is your first game, we recommend using the pitch with a single trapdoor.</li> <li>A dugout is placed at each end of the board, as shown in the diagram.</li> <li>Next, the coaches decide who will control each team. Each coach takes their six players, then places their Team card face up in front of them where it can easily be seen and referenced.</li> <li>Now shuffle the deck of 24 standard Challenge cards with the Bonus Play side face down and place it challenge-side up in the space next to the board that is marked with the ED icon. Then deal out the top three cards, challenge-side up, into the Active Challenge Card spaces - the top card of the deck is dealt into the '1' space, the next into the '2' space and the next into the '3' space.</li> <li>Next, the coach that lost the coin toss sets up their team in their End Zone, then the other coach does the same. When setting up their team, the coach can choose which square each of their players is placed in. Each square can only have one player in it.</li> <li>Each coach puts their score marker on the 0 space of the score track and puts their team coin near the board.</li> <li>Finally, place a ball on the trapdoor. If the coaches are using the side of the board that has two trapdoors, the coach who won the toss rolls a D6. On a result of 1, 2 or 3 the ball is placed on the trapdoor closest to their End Zone; on a 4, 5 or 6 it is placed on the trapdoor closest to their opponent's End Zone.</li> </ol> <p>Important: When placing the ball during setup you do not roll to see if the ball bounces (pg 12).

In addition, when a player makes a Run action, their move cannot take them adjacent to an Open or Marked opponent, but they can move adjacent to Prone players.

The result on the D6 is how far that player can move for that Run action.</p> <p>Picking up the Ball: A player that makes a Run action and moves into a square that contains a ball takes possession of that ball. If a player moves onto the ball in any other way - for example, when making a Mark or Sidestep action, or when pushed by an opponent - the ball bounces (pg 12). In addition, a player that already has possession of a ball cannot take possession of another ball (pg 6). When a player takes possession of a ball, that ball is moved onto that player's base to show that they have it (some of the balls have a small peg that fits into the hole on the player's base for just this purpose).

(p.23)</p> <p>A: The coach whose team turn has just taken place will resolve any Inducements, Skills, Traits, etc., that they have first, then their opponent will resolve any of theirs.</p> <p>Q: Can a team use more than one team re-roll in the same team turn? (p.24)</p> <p>A: Yes. Though be careful, as if you use them all early on in a half you will be facing quite a few turns without any! Remember that you can never re-roll a re-roll.</p> <p>Q: Are team re-rolls that are not spent during the first half lost for the second half as it states that only spent team re-rolls are replenished and unused ones are not carried over? (p.24)</p> <p>A: No. What this means is that a team will always start each half with their full complement of team re-rolls, and those that are not spent in the first half cannot then be saved to add on to your store of team re-rolls. A team that starts the first half with 3 team re-rolls, will also start the second half with 3 re-rolls.</p> <p>Q: If a player re-rolls a single dice from a dice pool with a Skill (e.g., Brawler), can they then use a team re-roll to allow them to re-roll the other dice from the same dice pool? (p.24)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: What exactly can a team re-roll be used to re-roll? (p.24)</p> <p>A: A team re-roll can only be used when a team is active and during its own team turn. It can be used to re-roll all the dice in a dice pool that were rolled during their team turn, including any dice pools rolled for any Skills or Traits used during that team turn. A team re-roll may not be used to re- roll the following rolls: Deviation, Scatter, Bounce, Armour, Injury, Casualty, Throw-in, Bribes, and Argue the Call.</p> <p>Q: Can I use a team re-roll to force an opposing coach to re-roll a dice in any circumstances? (p.24)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: If a player is bitten by a Vampire as a result of a failed Bloodlust roll and becomes Stunned (even if already Stunned), do they roll over and become Prone at the end of the turn in which they were Stunned, or the following turn? (p.27)</p> <p>A: At the end of the following turn.</p> <p>Q: If a player with a PA of 1+ scores a 1 for a Passing Ability test, after modifiers have been applied, is this still an Accurate Pass? (p.29)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: Can a team remove a team re-roll from their roster during a league in order to lower their Team Value? (p.34)</p> <p>A: No. Once a team re-roll has been bought it is permanent for the duration of the league.</p> <p>Q: When the Sweltering Heat result is rolled on the Weather table, is a single D3 rolled to determine the number of players from each team affected, or do both coaches roll a separate D3? (p.37)</p> <p>A: A single D3 is rolled and the same result is applied to each team.</p> <p>Q: If a team has fewer than 11 available players for a game, are they required to take on enough Journeymen to take their team temporarily to 11 before taking other Inducements such as Star Players? (p.38)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: After purchasing Inducements, do you add the value of the Inducements to your Current Team Value (CTV) when recalculating your CTV to determine which team is the \"Underdog\"? (p.38)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: If two teams have the same CTV, do either team gain Inducements and can either team spend gold pieces from their Treasury? (p.38)</p> <p>A: No to both questions.</p> <p>Q: During the Determine Kicking Team step, does the team that wins the coin toss or roll-off automatically become the kicking team, or may they choose to be either the kicking or receiving team? (p.38)</p> <p>A: They may choose.</p> <p>Q: If a team with the Low Cost Linemen special rule is forced to take on Journeymen, does the value of the Journeymen increase the Current Team Value of the team? (p.38 &amp; 106)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: Do Inducements purchased at step 4 of the pre-game sequence add to a team's Current Team Value (CTV) when CTV is recalculated when working out which team is the Underdog? (p.38)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: If a player is Sent-off as a result of Too Many Players, can their coach Argue the Call or use a Bribe to avoid them being Sent-off? (p.40)</p> <p>A: Yes, however, players that avoid being Sent-off in this manner do not stay on the pitch and will instead be placed in the Reserves box.</p> <p>Q: When a team sets up additional players on the pitch as a result of the Swarming trait, and this takes the number of players on the pitch to above 11, can players on that team be Sent-off as per the Too Many Players rule during that drive? (p.40 &amp; 87)</p> <p>A: No. The Too Many Players rule is used when there are more players than the team is allowed on the pitch (usually 11). The Swarming trait increases the number of players that team is allowed to field by D3 for the duration of the drive so, as long as the team does not exceed the new limit, their players cannot be Sent-off for Too Many Players. If there are any players fielded above the new limit for the Swarming team, they can be Sent-off for Too Many Players as normal.</p> <p>Q: What happens if a team cannot nominate a kicking player as all their players are either on the Line of Scrimmage or in a Wide Zone? (p.40)</p> <p>A: In this instance, simply nominate a player on the Line of Scrimmage instead.</p> <p>Q: If I roll a Blitz result on the Kick-off Event table, it states I am allowed to activate D3+3 Open players. Do these players need to be Open when the Kick-off event is rolled, or can I activate players that become Open during the Blitz, such as if a player pushes an opposition player away from a team-mate so that they are now Open? (p.41)</p> <p>A: They must be Open at the time of the Kick-off event.</p> <p>Q: During a Blitz result on the Kick-off Event table, if a player from the receiving team is Knocked Down does this end the Blitz? (p.41)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: If, during a Blitz kick-off event, a player with the Animal Savagery trait knocks down a player on their team as part of the Animal Savagery trait, will that cause the Blitz kick-off event to immediately end? (p.41 &amp; p.81)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: When a Blitz result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, it states one player may perform a Blitz action and one may perform a Throw Team-mate action. Are these included in the D3+3 players that can be activated, or in addition? (p.41)</p> <p>A: These are included as part of the D3+3.</p> <p>Q: During a Blitz result on the Kick-Off Event table, can I use a team re-roll? (p.41)</p> <p>A: No. A Kick-Off Blitz isn't a team turn. It represents the kicking team springing into action ahead of the receiving team.</p> <p>Q: Can a coach attempt to Argue the Call if a player is Sent-off as a result of the Officious Ref result on the Kick-off Event table? (p.41)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: Can a Bribe be used to prevent a player being Sent-off as a result of the Officious Ref Kick-off event? (p.41)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: If a tie is rolled for a Pitch Invasion on the Kick-off Event table, is a single D3 rolled to determine the number of players from each team affected, or do both coaches roll a separate D3? (p.41)</p> <p>A: A single D3 is rolled and the same result is applied to each team.</p> <p>Q: The rules for team turns state that a team turn ends when all eligible players have been activated. However, the rules for player activations state that coaches are not obliged to activate every player. Does this mean that coaches can choose to end their team turn without activating all of their eligible players if they wish? (p.42)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: Can a player that performed a Special action also make a Move action before or after performing the Special action? (p.43)</p> <p>A: No, unless the Special action in question specifically states otherwise or is performed as part of a Blitz action (if applicable). Note that some Special actions that can be used as part of a Blitz action also state that the player cannot move after performing the Special action.</p> <p>Q: Can a player with a MA of 2 or less attempt to Rush to Stand Up instead of attempting to roll a 4+ to stand up? (p.44)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: Can the Pro skill be used to re-roll the dice when a player attempts to stand up? (p.44)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: Does a player who has the Jump Up skill still need to roll to stand up if they also have a Movement Allowance of 2 or less? (p.44 &amp; 75)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: If a player that wishes to Jump over another player has no Movement Allowance remaining, can they Rush to Jump over the player? If so, how many Rush rolls are required? (p.45)</p> <p>A: Yes. Two Rush rolls will be required, one for each space moved. If the first Rush roll is failed, the player will Fall Over in the square they were in rather than the one they were attempting to Jump into.</p> <p>Q: What exactly is a Blitz action? (p.46)</p> <p>A: A Blitz action is a single declared action that comprises both a Move action and a Block action. If a player that declared a Blitz action is forced to lose its action, then it will lose the entire Blitz action.</p> <p>Q: Does a player that has declared a Blitz action have to perform a Block action as part of their Blitz action, or can they choose not to? (p.46)</p> <p>A: They may choose not to. However, this will still use the team's Blitz action for that turn.</p> <p>Q: Can a player declare a Blitz action even if they have no target in range? (p.46)</p> <p>A: Yes. They must still declare a target of the Block action (even if the target is not in range), and this will still use the team's Blitz action for the turn.</p> <p>Q: When a player declares an opposition player as the target of a Blitz action, can they change their mind during the Blitz action and instead make the Block action against a different player? (p.46)</p> <p>A: No. When a player declares a Blitz action against an opposition player, the targeted player is the only player they may perform the Block action against. They may choose not to make the Block action at all, though the team's Blitz action for the turn is still used.</p> <p>Q: Can a player make a Pass action to an adjacent friendly player? (p.48)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: When making a Passing Ability test, if the roll is not a natural 1, but is reduced to less than 1 after modifiers have been applied, is this an inaccurate pass or a wildly inaccurate pass? (p.49)</p> <p>A: This will be a wildly inaccurate pass.</p> <p>Q: If an inaccurate or wildly inaccurate pass goes out of bounds, do you roll for passing interference before or after the throw-in? If before, where do you count the ball as for the purpose of placing the range ruler to determine which players can attempt to interfere? (p. 50)</p> <p>A: Before. When placing the range ruler to determine which players can attempt to interfere, treat the ball as occupying the last square it was over before going out of bounds.</p> <p>Q: When resolving a Throw-in, is the square which has the Blood Bowl logo from the Throw-in template on it treated as the first square along the path, or is it treated as 'square 0' and the distance is measured from that square? (p.51)</p> <p>A: It is treated as square 0.</p> <p>Q: If a thrown player lands in an occupied square and then subsequently bounces into another occupied square, is the player that is in the new occupied square also Knocked Down? (p.54)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: If a player with the Mighty Blow (+X) skill makes a Block action, and chooses the Both Down result and is Knocked Down themselves, can they still apply the effects of Mighty Blow (+X)? (p.57 &amp; 80)</p> <p>A: No, as when the Armour roll is made for the opposition player, the player with Mighty Blow (+X) is Prone and so cannot use the skill.</p> <p>Q: When a player makes a Blitz action, do they have to nominate the target of the Block action before the player is moved? (p.59)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: What happens if a player suffers a characteristic reduction as the result of an injury, but the characteristic that would be reduced is already at its minimum value? For example, a ST 1 player that suffers a Dislocated Shoulder (-1 ST). (p.61)</p> <p>A: If a player that suffers a characteristic reduction is already at their minimum value, it cannot be reduced further. Instead, roll again on the Lasting Injury table until a different result that can be applied is rolled.</p> <p>Q: If a player with a Passing Ability of 6+ suffers a Broken Arm and has their PA reduced by 1, what happens? (p.61)</p> <p>A: Characteristics can ever be reduced below the minimum value shown on page 28 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook, so nothing would happen.</p> <p>Q: If a player is Sent-off, which happens first: using a Bribe, Argue the Call, or is the order up to the Sent-off player's coach? (p.63 &amp; 91)</p> <p>A: Argue the Call will always happen first, followed by any Bribes (if able).</p> <p>Q: Do I have to Argue the Call in order to use a Bribe? (p.63 &amp; 91)</p> <p>A: No, but should the Bribe fail, you cannot then attempt to Argue the Call as the chance to do so has passed.</p> <p>Q: If a coach is ejected for having rolled a 1 when attempting to Argue the Call, are they only prevented from using a Bribe Inducement for that one sending off, or for the rest of the game? (p.63 &amp; 91)</p> <p>A: Just for that particular sending off.</p> <p>Q: During the End of Drive Sequence, what happens first: players are Sent-off for the Secret Weapon trait, or any end of drive weather effects (such as Sweltering Heat)? (p.66)</p> <p>A: During the End of Drive Sequence, Secret Weapons are always Sent-off before any other effects.</p> <p>Q: Can you clarify what the penalties are for conceding a game? (p.67)</p> <p>A: If a player concedes a match, they immediately lose the game. Then, follow the procedure outlined on page 67 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook.</p> <p>Q: If a game goes to extra time, how many additional turns are taken by each coach? (p.67)</p> <p>A: Each coach will take 8 team turns.</p> <p>Q: If a player makes a superb Kick Team-mate Special action, does it generate Star Player Points like a Throw Team-mate Special action? (p.70)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: If a player converts a Deflection into an Interception, will they gain 2 Star Player Points for the Interception, or 3 Star Player Points - 2 for the Interception, and 1 for the initial Deflection? (p.70)</p> <p>A: They will gain 2 Star Player Points for the Interception.</p> <p>Q: In League Play, are Infamous Coaching Staff and Infamous Sideline Staff who play in the game, such as Josef Bugman, eligible for the MVP award? (p.70 &amp; 93)</p> <p>A: No. Though these folk might think of themselves as players, they are coaches and support staff \u2013 infamous ones at that!</p> <p>Q: What happens when a player with a PA of '-' rolls an improvement to its PA? (p.71)</p> <p>A: Either choose another listed option, or improve its PA to 6+.</p> <p>Q: If a player randomly selects a characteristic improvement, and then decides they do not want to take the characteristic improvement they have rolled, they can instead take a Secondary skill. Could they instead choose a Primary skill if they wanted? (p.71)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: If I hire a Journeyman that gained an advancement during Step 3 of the post-game sequence, how much do they cost to hire? (p.72)</p> <p>A: They will cost the same as their Current Value, including the cost of any advancements gained.</p> <p>Q: What happens if a player rolls a random Skill and gains one that they could take, but cannot actually use? Such as if a player with the No Hands trait gained the Catch skill. (p.74)</p> <p>A: In these instances, roll again until they gain a Skill they could actually use.</p> <p>Q: If a player with an AV of 8+ (or worse) randomly gains the Iron Hard Skin skill, does this count as them gaining a Skill they cannot use as the Skill will have no effect? (p.74)</p> <p>A: Yes. They may re-roll.</p> <p>Q: Can players that are Prone, Stunned, or have lost their Tackle Zone still use skills such as Dodge, Block, Sidestep or Wrestle (amongst others)? (p.74)</p> <p>A: No. A player that is Prone, Stunned, or has lost their Tackle Zone cannot use any Skills or Traits unless it is specifically stated in the description of that Skill or Trait.</p> <p>Q: Can the Catch skill be used when attempting to catch a Bomb? (p.75)</p> <p>A: No, a Bomb is not a ball.</p> <p>Q: What happens if a player already has the Catch skill or the Monstrous Mouth skill and randomly rolls the other Skill?  (p.75 &amp; 78)</p> <p>A: If a player has the Monstrous Mouth skill and subsequently rolls the Catch skill, then they should re-roll. If a player has the Catch skill and subsequently rolls the Monstrous Mouth skill, then they may not re-roll, as the Monstrous Mouth skill provides an additional benefit.</p> <p>Q: If a player with the Diving Catch skill attempts to catch the ball when it is landing in an adjacent square and fails, does the ball bounce from the player who failed the catch, or from where it was going to initially land? (p.75)</p> <p>A: The ball will bounce from where it was initially going to land.</p> <p>Q: If a player attempts to Dodge away from a player with the Diving Tackle skill and fails the original Dodge roll, but then uses a re-roll and succeeds, can the player with Diving Tackle use this Skill on the re-rolled attempt? (p.75)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: If a player with the Leap skill or Pogo Stick trait has used all of their Movement Allowance and is attempting to use the Leap skill or Pogo Stick trait to jump over a square, what happens if they fail the Rush roll? (p.75 &amp; 85)</p> <p>A: If the Rush fails, then the player will fall over in the square they have moved into, do not roll the Agility test for the jumping player.</p> <p>Q: Can a player with the Sneaky Git skill that performs a Foul action still be Sent-off if it rolls a natural double on the Injury roll? (p.75)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: What happens if the ball lands in the Tackle Zones of multiple players from the same team with the Diving Catch skill? (p.75)</p> <p>A: Each player may attempt to catch the ball, in an order chosen by the controlling coach.</p> <p>Q: What happens if the ball lands in the Tackle Zones of multiple players from opposing teams with the Diving Catch skill? (p.75)</p> <p>A: Each player may attempt to catch the ball, in an order chosen by the controlling coach.</p> <p>Q: Can the Dodge skill be used on moves outside of a player's activation, such as those provided from On the Ball, or the Blitz result on the Kick-off Event table? (p.75)</p> <p>A: No. The Dodge skill can only be used to re-roll a Dodge roll during that player's activation during their own team turn.</p> <p>Q: If a player with the Safe Pair of Hands skill is targeted by a Block action performed by a player with the Strip Ball skill, and they suffer a Push Back result, can they still use Safe Pair of Hands? (p.75)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: If a player with the Safe Pair of Hands skill is Knocked Down, and there are no empty squares for them to put the ball into, what happens? (p.75)</p> <p>A: The Safe Pair of Hands skill cannot be used in this instance, and so the ball will bounce as normal.</p> <p>Q: Can the Sure Feet skill be used on moves outside of a player's activation, such as those provided from the Blitz result on the Kick-off Event table? (p.75)</p> <p>A: No. The Sure Feet skill can only be used during that player's activation.</p> <p>Q: Can a Biased Referee be used against an opposition player with Sneaky Git that rolled a double for the Armour roll, and was not Sent-off due to the Sneaky Git skill? (p.75 &amp; 95)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: If a player with the Animal Savagery trait also has the Jump Up skill, do they still get the +2 to the roll if they wish to attempt to make a Block action while prone? (p.75 &amp; 81)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: If a player has both the Jump Up skill and the Stab trait, can they use the Jump Up skill to allow them to make a Block action from Prone on a 2+ and then replace this Block action with a Stab Special action?

(p.77)</p> <p>A: No. The Pro skill can only be used during that player's activation.</p> <p>Q: What exactly can the Pro skill be used to re-roll? (p.77)</p> <p>A: The Pro skill can be used to re-roll a single dice rolled by that player, either on its own, as part of a multiple roll, or as part of a dice pool. It cannot be used to re-roll a dice that was rolled as part of an Armour, Injury or Casualty roll, a roll that is not made during its own activation (such as Regeneration) or a dice that is not rolled on behalf of the player specifically (such as a Bribe or Argue the Call).</p> <p>Q: A player with both the Pro skill and Brawler skill performs Block, rolls two Block Dice and rolls Both Down on both dice, can the controlling coach choose to use Brawler on one of the dice, and then subsequently attempt to use Pro on the other dice that has not yet been re-rolled?

(p.77)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: Can the Strip Ball skill be used to make a player who used the Stand Firm skill drop the ball? (p.77 &amp; 80)</p> <p>A: Yes, if the player chooses not to be pushed back, they will drop the ball in the square they are standing in.</p> <p>Q: If a player has both the Frenzy skill and the Stab trait, if they declare a Block action which results in a Pushed Back result when they follow up and have to perform a second Block action, can they then use the Stab trait to replace the second Block action with the Stab Special action?

(p.78)</p> <p>A: No, as Foul Appearance only triggers when the player is chosen as the target of either a Block action or a Special action.</p> <p>Q: If a player uses the Ball &amp; Chain Move special action and moves out of the Tackle Zone of a player with the Tentacles skill, does the player with Tentacles get to use the Skill? (p.78 &amp; 82)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: If a player with a Trait that requires them to roll a dice to see if they can activate normally (such as Bone Head or Unchanneled Fury) and wishes to declare a player with either the Foul Appearance or Dump-off skills as the target of an action, do they roll for their Trait or for the opposing player's Skill first? (p.78 &amp; 79)</p> <p>A: The player will first nominate the target of their action, then roll for their Trait and then the opposing player will use their Skill</p> <p>Q: Can a player with both the Dump-off and the Pass skills use the Pass skill when making a Pass action as part of the Dump- off skill? (p.79)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: When a player with the Dump-off skill is nominated as the target of a Blitz action, when do they make their Quick Pass action? (p.79)</p> <p>A: As soon as they are nominated as the target of the Blitz action.</p> <p>Q: Can multiple players from the same team use the On The Ball skill in response to the same Pass action? If so, what happens if one of them Falls Over before the others have been able to use the On The Ball skill? (p.79)</p> <p>A: Yes. However, if one player Falls Over before the others have been able to use the On The Ball skill then the sequence ends and no further players can move.</p> <p>Q: Can any of the Passing skills that are used when performing a Pass action also be used when performing a Throw Team-mate action? (p.79)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: Is a Hail Mary Pass treated as a Long bomb when determining any modifiers for testing for accuracy? (p.79) A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: If a player with the Leader re-roll is removed from the pitch before their Leader re-roll has been used, then the re-roll would be lost. If the player would subsequently return to the pitch (such as recovering from being KO'd), is the re-roll available again? (p.79)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: If multiple players on a team have the On the Ball skill, can they all move if an opposition player declares a Pass action? (p.79)</p> <p>A: Yes, if their controlling coach wishes.</p> <p>Q: When exactly can a player with Running Pass move after the pass is resolved? (p.79)</p> <p>A: After the ball is successfully caught, provided no Turnover was caused.</p> <p>Q: Does the Cannoneer skill still apply when a player makes a Hail Mary Pass? (p.79)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: If a player with the Safe Pass skill and Running Pass skill fumbles a Pass action, does their activation end or can they make use of Running Pass? (p.79)</p> <p>A: Their activation will end.</p> <p>Q: If a player with the Fumblerooskie skill begins their Activation without the ball, and then picks it up during their Activation, can they still use the Fumblerooskie skill during their Activation?

(p.79 &amp; 83)</p> <p>A: The bomb will not be dropped and will not explode in the player's hands. The player's activation will still end.</p> <p>Q: Can a player who made a Throw Bomb Special action still use the Running Pass skill to move after throwing the bomb? (p.79 &amp; 83)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: Brawler states that a player can use this skill when making a Block action on its own (but not as part of a Blitz action). Can a player with this skill use it when it has an assist from a friendly player? (p.80)</p> <p>A: Yes. The 'on its own' part simply means it can only be used as a regular Block action, and not part of another action that includes a Block (such as a Blitz action).</p> <p>Q: Can a player with the Grab skill choose not to use it if they wish? (p.80)</p> <p>A: Yes. Remember that only Skills and Traits marked with an * are compulsory.</p> <p>Q: Can a player with the Guard skill still provide offensive and defensive assists when they have lost their Tackle Zone? (p.80)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: If a player that is performing a Block action against a player with the Mighty Blow (+1) skill rolls the Player Down! result, can the defending player use the Mighty Blow (+1) skill? (p.80)</p> <p>A: No, as the player with the Mighty Blow (+1) skill has not performed the Block action.</p> <p>Q: If a player with Multiple Block also has the Grab skill, can they place the second opposition player that they Blocked into the square that was initially occupied by the first opposition player that they Blocked? (p.80)</p> <p>A: No, as both Block actions happen simultaneously.</p> <p>Q: If a player has both the Mighty Blow (+X) skill and the Claws trait, they cannot use the Mighty Blow (+X) skill to modify the Armour roll due to Claws, but can they still use it to modify the Injury roll? (p.80)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: When a player with the Multiple Block skill declares two adjacent opposing players the target of their Block, do both opponents grant defensive assists to each other if there are no other players from the active team marking them? (p.80)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: The Pile Driver skill states that the player performing the Block action may then perform a 'free' Foul action against the Knocked Down player. Does this 'free' Foul action mean that it does not count towards the team's one Foul action per turn, or does it mean that the player can perform this action for free? (p.80)</p> <p>A: This means that the player may perform this action for free. This Skill cannot be used if the team has already used their Foul action for that team turn, and if used will mean that another player cannot also make a Foul action during the same team turn.</p> <p>Q: Does the free Foul action from Pile Driver happen before or after making the Armour roll (and potentially an Injury roll) for the player being Knocked Down? (p.80)</p> <p>A: After - so long as the player is still on the pitch, of course!</p> <p>Q: Can the Stab trait be used in conjunction with the Multiple Block skill to make two Stab Special actions? (p.80 &amp; 86)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: If my player with Animal Savagery trait lashes out against my own teammate and also has the Pile Driver skill, is my opponent able to make me perform a foul against my own teammate? (p.81)</p> <p>A: No, they cannot force you to use the Pile Driver skill.</p> <p>Q: If a player with Animal Savagery knocks down a friendly model, are they forced to use Claws, Piledriver, Mighty Blow (X+) (or any other Skills that would affect Armour or Injury rolls), or can they choose not to? (p.81)</p> <p>A: The only Skills the opposing coach may choose for the player with Animal Savagery to use are Claws and Mighty Blow (+X). In this case, treat the Knock Down as being the result of a Block action.</p> <p>Q: If a player with Animal Savagery knocks down a team- mate that hasn't yet activated during that team turn, can the Knocked Down player still activate provided they haven't been Stunned or removed from the pitch? (p.81)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: Will a Prone player that fails its roll for Animal Savagery still lash out against a team-mate?

(p.82)</p> <p>A: No, the only action a player with the Ball and Chain trait can perform is a 'Ball and Chain Move' special action.</p> <p>Q: If a player with the Ball and Chain trait rolls the Piledriver skill as a random Skill, can they re-roll it? (p.82)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: Does a player with Ball and Chain trait generate Star Player Points if they cause a Casualty as part of a Block action performed during a 'Ball and Chain Move' Special action?

(p.82)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: Does a player with the Ball and Chain trait have to use their full Movement Allowance? (p.82)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: What assists, if any, does a Ball and Chain player receive when they are forced to Block a friendly player as per the Ball and Chain Move Special action?

(p.82)</p> <p>A: The coach of the player performing the Block action.</p> <p>Q: If a player with the Ball and Chain trait moves into a square occupied by a Prone or Stunned player, does the resulting Armour roll benefit from the Mighty Blow (+X) skill if applicable?

(p.83)</p> <p>A: No, because a bomb is not a ball.</p> <p>Q: Can a player use a re-roll of any kind (team re-roll, Pro, etc.) to re-roll to see if a bomb that was caught will explode? (p.83)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: If a player Deflects a Bomb, but fails to convert it into an Interception, will it scatter from the square they are in or will they drop it? (p.83)</p> <p>A: It will scatter from the square they are in in the same manner as a Deflected ball.</p> <p>Q: When using the Bombardier trait, can a re-roll be used when determining if a bomb that is caught explodes? (p.83)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: If a player making a Throw Bomb Special action fumbles the Bomb, does this cause a Turnover? (p.83)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: Can a player with the Chainsaw trait choose to perform a standard Block action instead of a Chainsaw Attack Special action? (p.84)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: When a player with the Chainsaw trait uses their chainsaw as part of a Foul action, will they still be subjected to the same offensive assists and defensive assists as a normal Foul action? (p.84)</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: Can a player with the Hypnotic Gaze trait perform the Hypnotic Gaze Special action in the same activation in which they declared a Block action, Blitz action, Foul action or Pass action? (p.85)</p> <p>A: No. Hypnotic Gaze is a Special action, and therefore must be declared at the start of a player's activation like all other actions (p.42). The Hypnotic Gaze Special action allows a player to move before they perform the Hypnotic Gaze Special action if they wish.</p> <p>Q: Does a player who has lost their Tackle Zone as a result of the Hypnotic Gaze trait have to drop the ball? (p.85)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: Does a player with the Hypnotic Gaze trait, who targets a player with the Foul Appearance skill, need to roll for Foul Appearance before performing the Hypnotic Gaze special action?

(p.85)</p> <p>A: No, a player with the Pogo Stick trait ignores all negative modifiers applied for being Marked when attempting to Leap.</p> <p>Q: Can a team re-roll be used to re-roll a Regeneration roll under any circumstances?

What kind of self-respecting referee is going to turn down more gold?</p> <p>Q: If a player holding the ball is turned into a frog as the result of the Zap! spell and the ball is forced to bounce, is a Turnover caused? (p.94)</p> <p>A: No.</p> <p>Q: If I have induced a Biased Referee, does this mean my coach cannot be ejected when Arguing the Call as the Biased Referee gives a bonus of +1 when rolling to Argue the Call, and the coach is only ejected on the roll of a 1? Or is a natural 1 always a failure? (p.95)</p> <p>A: A natural 1 is not always a failure when rolling to Argue the Call, so having a Biased Referee means that the coach cannot be ejected as they will always receive the +1 to the roll.</p> <p>Q: For scoring additional League points, will a team score the additional +1 for conceding 0 touchdowns only if their opponent concedes the game having not scored a touchdown, or does this mean that a team simply needs to not concede a touchdown during the game (i.e., 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, etc.)?

(p.100)</p> <p>A: Only for re-hiring a player in question. So, a player that is worth 50,000 gold pieces could be hired for 70,000 gold pieces from your budget in their second season, but would still be worth 50,000 gold pieces on the Team Draft list.</p> <p>Q: Can a team with the Masters of Undeath special rule still attempt to Raise the Dead if the Necromancer has been Sent Off?

At any given game, there are a large number of fans who attend purely to watch the endless antics on the sidelines. And this should come as no surprise; between the drama of watching the head coaches and team owners as they navigate the peaks and troughs of emotion as their team's fortunes soar and plummet, to the endless parade of performers employed to keep the fans from turning on one another when the game gets a bit boring, an afternoon of Blood Bowl is an endless feast for the senses.</p> <p>This supplement focuses, for the most part, on the unsung stars of the sidelines.

These allow a coach to create the perfect hireling Mercenary to play for their team, a Star Player all of their own to bring some variety to their squad.</p> <p>Finally, the rules for Blood Bowl Sevens allow coaches to explore the wonderful world of amateur sports.

In the earliest days of the modern game, this advice was followed closely, but it quickly became apparent that no matter how careful one attempts to be, the pig in question will always object. What's more, once the pig has raised an objection, it rapidly becomes extremely uncooperative! Reasoning that there was probably a better way, the nascent NAF began to fiddle with the design of its balls.</p> <p>One early innovation was shelved at an early stage. The story goes that Roze-El was presented with a spherical ball by a young research acolyte by the name of Sochere. Supposedly, the Sochere ball was easier to handle and not given to such erratic bouncing, meaning it could be kicked with more precision and passed from player to player with greater ease. Roze-El quickly dismissed the notion, stating that, as far as he was concerned, all balls are ovoid, that spherical balls felt wrong and that no one would want to handle one, whereas ovoid balls were easy to carry. No one wanted the game to become one of kick-ball, the objective was to pick up, carry and pass the ball! Since that time, the design of a Blood Bowl ball has been greatly refined and standardised by both the NAF and the RARG. Today, players the world over can be assured that, when they grab a ball, it will be reassuringly ovoid.</p> <p>Modern balls tend to follow the same basic construction; an inflated bladder (often synthetic) is encased in a stitched leather shell. This structure is, in turn, supported and strengthened by bands of metal, onto which are affixed sharp, inch-long spikes, the better to help with grip in the wet and to encourage bloodshed in the scrum.</p> <p>Yet, in spite of standardisation by the sport's governing bodies, there still exist a great variety of balls in the world. Most races have their own preferences and prejudices when it comes to balls and, consequently, there are more types of ball in common use than one might think.</p>"},{"location":"death_zone/a_load_of_balls/#unusual-blood-bowl-balls","title":"UNUSUAL BLOOD BOWL BALLS","text":"<p>From live squigs, full of teeth and an unwillingness to play ball, to icons devoted to the Dark Gods, steeped in their fell power and utterly deadly to the touch, there is no limit to the things that have made their way onto the Blood</p> <p>Bowl pitch in place of a regulation ball.

The inclusion of these rules in a league or tournament is at the discretion of the league commissioner or tournament organiser. Otherwise, coaches who wish to use these rules for an exhibition game should decide this between themselves.</p> <p>USING UNUSUAL BALLS</p> <p>Once per game, after Step 1 but before Step 2 of the Start of Drive sequence when they are the kicking team, the coach can declare that they will use an unusual ball.

If the roll on the Kick-off table is a double, the ref calls the kicking player out for their flagrant rules violation and they are immediately Sent-off as though they had committed a Foul (before resolving the Kick-off result). Note that even if the player is Sent-off, the special ball remains in play for this drive!</p> <p>For the duration of the drive, the rules for the unusual ball in use apply.

In truth, the various balls that come with the different teams fall into several broad types. This list is designed to cover all of those types in broad terms rather than every single ball, and even offers a couple of alternative uses for balls of a similar type. For example, both the Limpin' Squig (from the Orc team) and the Greedy Nurgling (from the Nurgle team) are examples of a 'creature'. But so too is the Snotling Ball-suit, the Spiteful Sprite Ball and the Skeletal Ball (from the Shambling Undead team). Should you wish, these rules and these models are fully interchangeable, it is simply more fun when naming a rule and writing the description to focus upon one specific ball, so that's what we've done!

In addition to these stadia, many provincial teams active in the minor leagues owned a stadium as well, whilst others rented use of one, often NAF-owned, in their hometown.

Roll a D6 on the Local Crowd table (see page 65) to determine an Attribute."},{"location":"death_zone/blood_bowl_stadia/#unusual-playing-surface","title":"UNUSUAL PLAYING SURFACE","text":"D6 ATTRIBUTE 1 Ankle-deep Water: The pitch is flooded! Not just wet, it's actually flooded and lies under a good three inches of water! Every time a player Falls Over, apply a -1 modifier to the Armour roll. Additionally, whenever a Stunned player rolls over at the end of either teams' turn, roll a D6. On a roll of 1, lying face-down in the water has done them no favours, and they remain Stunned for another turn. 2 Sloping Pitch: The stadium is built on a serious incline. Good for one team, a nightmare for the other!  At the start of the first drive, roll a D6: \u2022 On a roll of 4+, it is sloping down towards the kicking team's End Zone.\u00a0\u2022 On a roll of 1-3, the pitch is sloping down towards the receiving team's End Zone.  Whenever the ball bounces, do not use the Random Direction template; instead, use the Throw-in template, oriented so that the 3-4 points directly down the slope.  Additionally, players can attempt to Rush one additional time, as long as it takes them closer to the End Zone at the bottom of the slope.  After half-time, the pitch will slope the other way, representing the teams changing ends. 3 Ice: A violent sport on ice? It'll never catch on. Every time the ball bounces, it moves two squares in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template, rather than the usual 1. Additionally, whenever a player Falls Over or is Knocked Down, they will slide one square in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template. If they would slide into an occupied square, they do not move. If they slide off the pitch, they risk Injury by the crowd as normal. If they slide into a square occupied by the ball, the ball will bounce.  Note that the players are assumed to have been issued with appropriate kit to traverse the ice skates, snowshoes or enchanted cleats so their movement is not affected. 4 Astrogranite: This artificial stone substitute was all the rage in the 2480s and some stadia still keep it for its extra-grippy surface (and the fact that it's always entertaining when players fall down!). Apply a +1 modifier to the Armour roll every time a player Falls Over or is Knocked Down whilst playing on astrogranite.  In addition, if a player Falls Over whilst Rushing on astrogranite, roll a D6: \u2022 On a roll of 4+, the player remains Standing, but they cannot attempt to Rush again. \u2022 On a roll of 1-3, the player Falls Over as normal. 5 Uneven Footing: Covered in bumps and riddled with holes, the playing surface at this stadium is one big tripping hazard. All players suffer a -1 modifier to their MA for the duration of this game, to a minimum of MA3. However, players can attempt to Rush one extra square during their activation. This means most players can attempt to Rush three times, whilst players with the Sprint skill, for example, can attempt to Rush four times. 6 Solid Stone: Dwarf-owned and operated stadia started a trend for solid stone playing surfaces way back in the 2430s. Not only does a polished marble pitch look wonderful, but it is greatly entertaining! In recent years, quite a few stone stadia have been built above ground. Every time the ball bounces, it moves two squares in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template, rather than the usual one. In addition, apply a +1 modifier to the Armour roll every time a player Falls Over or is Knocked Down whilst playing on polished stone."},{"location":"death_zone/blood_bowl_stadia/#rough-ready-stadium","title":"ROUGH &amp; READY STADIUM","text":"D6 ATTRIBUTE 1 Apathetic Officials: Whether they don't get paid enough, don't enjoy Blood Bowl, or they are just being deliberately difficult, the officials at this particular Blood Bowl venue just don't seem all that interested. At the start of each half, each team gains a free Bribe Inducement. Note that, if a team does not use its free Bribe during the first half, it will start the second half with two free Bribes. 2 Appalling Stands: There aren't enough seats, there are nails sticking out of every surface, and there's a weird smell coming from somewhere. There is a very real risk that the fans will start leaving and, even worse, asking for a refund! At the end of each drive, both coaches roll a D6 to determine if their fans have started leaving:\u00a0\u2022 On a roll of 2+, the fans are willing to put up with the discomfort.\u00a0\u2022 On a roll of 1, fans have started leaving, and the team must reduce its Fan Factor by 1. Note that neither team's Fan Factor can fall below 0. 3 Uncovered Trapdoors: Either for budgetary reasons or just for the amusement of onlookers, the trapdoors on this pitch could more accurately be described as large, yawning holes in the ground. Every time any player enters a Trapdoor square (voluntarily or otherwise), the player is immediately removed from play. Treat them exactly as if they had been pushed into the crowd. If the ball ever comes to rest in a Trapdoor square, it will be enthusiastically thrown back out by a helpful groundskeeper. The ball immediately deviates from the Trapdoor square. 4 Unclear Markings: The pitch is little more than a rectangle of grass with a faded line roughly dividing it into two halves. When the kicking team sets up for a drive, they may choose to treat their Line of Scrimmage as being:\u00a0\u2022 The normal Line of Scrimmage.\u00a0\u2022 One row of squares further back into their own half.\u00a0\u2022 One row of squares into the other team's half. This creates a temporary halfway line for this kick-off which the receiving team must adhere to when setting up their players, and which is used for the purposes of awarding a touchback. In addition, the limit of two players per Wide Zone during set-up does not apply for either team. 5 Desperate for Exposure: The owners of this stadium aren't happy that the official status of their prized possession is 'Provincial Backwater'. Recently, they have begun a drive to improve their reputation and attract a better class of clientele. For this reason, the stadium owners are offering incentives for any teams willing to play there. During Step 1 of the post-game sequence, each team receives an additional D6 x 10,000 gold pieces in winnings (make one roll and apply the result to both teams' winnings). 6 Poorly-built Dungeons: Long ago, the RARG realized that sending off certain players didn't work; many a career cheat just kept sneaking back on! To combat this, the NAF introduced guidelines requiring every stadium to feature a secure dungeon where miscreants could be locked away until the final whistle. Not every stadium owner welcomed this expensive new legislation. Consequently, many dungeons aren't up to code, and the chances of keeping a player committed to dirty play under lock and key aren't great when the dungeon locks are unreliable and the bars are surprisingly far apart. During Step 2 of the end of a drive sequence, each coach rolls a D6 for each of their players that have been Sent-off for any reason. On a roll of 5+, the player is returned to the Reserves box."},{"location":"death_zone/blood_bowl_stadia/#luxury-stadium","title":"LUXURY STADIUM","text":"D6 ATTRIBUTE 1 Integrated Merchandise Stalls: From team flags and noisemakers to giant, pointing fingers and woodcut portraits of popular players, this stadium sells it all. What's even better is the teams are entitled to a healthy cut of the profits, huzzah! During Step 1 of the post-game sequence, each team receives an additional D3 x 10,000 gold pieces in winnings (each coach rolls a D3 and applies the result to their team's winnings). 2 Reputation for Spectacle: This stadium is well-known for the spectacular games (and half-time shows) it hosts, and visiting teams can expect a sizeable allowance from the promoters to make the game more interesting. During Step 4 of the pre-game sequence, both coaches are awarded additional gold pieces in the form of petty cash to spend on Inducements for the game ahead. To determine how much, each coach rolls a D6. The results are then added together and multiplied by 10,000. Each team gains that many gold pieces in petty cash. 3 Broadcast Studio: Every game played at this stadium goes out live on one of the big networks. Every single one, even the rather rubbish ones. Unsurprisingly, the big names of the game are always happy to be seen running across the pitch or shouting from the sidelines at this stadium. During Step 4 of the pre-game sequence, Star Players, Mercenary Players, (In)Famous Coaching Staff, Named Wizards and Biased Referees can all be Induced for D3 x 10,000 gold pieces less than normal (to a minimum of 10,000 gold pieces). Roll separately for each Inducement you wish to hire to determine the discount being offered. 4 On-site Apothecaries: This stadium is so well-heeled that the teams are given top-notch, first-class medical assistance, often by trained medical professionals capable of giving them more than just a shave and a haircut! During Step 4 of the pre-game sequence, a team that can hire an apothecary is granted a free Wandering Apothecary Inducement. In the case of teams that are unable to hire an apothecary:  \u00a0\u2022 A team with the 'Masters of Undeath' special rule is granted a free Mortuary Assistant Inducement.  \u00a0\u2022 A team with the 'Favoured of Nurgle' special rule is granted a free Plague Doctor Inducement. 5 Enclosed Pitch: The pitch is surrounded by a high and sturdy wall, or is built into the very ground in the form of a pit. Spectators sit high above the pitch, looking down upon the action below. Players cannot be pushed into the crowd for any reason. Rather than being pushed into the crowd, a pushed back player is instead slammed with great force into the stadium wall and is Knocked Down in the square they occupy. In addition, the ball cannot bounce into the crowd (though a kick-off or Pass action can still cause the ball to deviate or scatter into the crowd). Instead of bouncing into the crowd and being thrown-in, the ball will bounce off a wall. Use the Throw-in template to determine the direction as normal, but rather than travel 2D6 squares, the ball bounces only one square away from the wall before coming to rest. Note that thrown players can land in the crowd as normal. 6 Deluxe Seating: The stands at this stadium have all the mod cons: heated seats, plentiful bars, and even toilet facilities! The resultant good mood amongst the fans means the atmosphere is very jovial and, consequently, generates lots of support for the teams. During each start of drive sequence after the first, between Steps 2 and 3, each coach rolls a D3 and adds their team's current Dedicated Fans characteristic. If the result is higher than their team's Fan Factor for this game, their team gains one extra team re-roll for the drive ahead. If this team re-roll is not used before the end of this drive, it is lost."},{"location":"death_zone/blood_bowl_stadia/#local-crowd","title":"LOCAL CROWD","text":"D6 ATTRIBUTE 1 Ale-fuelled Maniacs: The local fans are a bunch of rabid nutters, and that's before they start drinking.

The stadium's security staff are doing their best to prevent the fans storming the pitch, but woe betide any player daft enough to set foot in the stands! Each coach's Fan Factor is increased by 1. In addition, if a player is pushed into the crowd, apply a +1 to the Injury roll. Finally, if a Pitch Invasion result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table at any point, apply a +1 modifier to the D3 when determining how many players are affected. 3 Know-it-all Hecklers: Everyone in this crowd seems to be an expert on the finer points of the rules of the game, and their screamed corrections are doing nothing to improve the referee's temper. If a player commits a Foul which results in the victim of the action being removed from the pitch, but is not Sent-off for doing so, roll a D6:\u00a0\u2022 On a roll of 4+, the referee ignores the crowd's indignation.\u00a0\u2022 On a roll of 1-3, the referee hears the crowd's screamed indignation, and the player is Sent-off. 4 Bunch of Pacifists: The local crowd are much happier watching the violence than getting involved with the weirdos!

In addition, if a player is pushed into the crowd, roll a D6:\u00a0\u2022 On a roll of 4+, there is no risk of Injury by the Crowd, and the player is placed in their team's Reserves box.\u00a0\u2022 On a roll of 1-3, the player risks Injury by the Crowd as normal. 5 Fickle Fans: Maybe this stadium gives away lots of free tickets because at least half of the crowd look like they've got places they'd rather be. At the end of each drive, roll a D6 to determine if the fans have started leaving:\u00a0\u2022 On a roll of 2+, the fans are willing to stay for a little while longer.\u00a0\u2022 On a roll of 1, fans have started leaving, and both teams must reduce their Fan Factor by 1. Note that neither team's Fan Factor can fall below 0. In addition, if the ball leaves the pitch, it might take a while for someone to throw it back. Unless this is the final turn of the half, roll a D6:\u00a0\u2022 On a roll of 4+, the ball is thrown back in as normal.\u00a0\u2022 On a roll of 1-3, the ball is not thrown back in until the end of the next team turn. In either case, the ball is thrown in as normal from the last square it occupied before leaving the pitch. 6 Solemn and Silent: An old sporting legend tells of the god, Kri-wiket, who forbade any noise other than polite applause at the day-long games played in his honor. The crowd at this stadium seems determined to follow his teachings! For the duration of this game, cheerleaders have no effect on the Kick-off Event table results. In addition, if a player is pushed into the crowd, they do not risk Injury by the Crowd and can return to play at the start of their next team turn. When a player is returned to the pitch in this way, they are Placed Prone in a square that is both: a. Adjacent to the Sideline. b.

They limited this aid to one spell per match, and even this had to be chosen from a very limited spellbook and cast by an officially-appointed Colleges of Magic Sports-Wizard, whom in turn had to have a special license from the new governing body for such things (that's right, the Colleges of Magic!).

Instead, they are Induced during the pre-game sequence in exactly the same way as other Mercenary players. Giants may be used alongside the Mercenary Player Inducements in the Blood Bowl rulebook, or those presented previously in this supplement.</p> <p>Giants have the following profile:</p> MA ST AG PA AV Giant 6 7 5+ 5+ 11+ <p>Skills &amp; Traits: Always Hungry, Bone Head, Break Tackle, Juggernaut, Loner (4+), Mighty Blow (+2), Multiple Block, Stand Firm, Throw Team-mate</p> <p>SPECIAL RULES</p> <p>Giants are big. Bigger than Ogres, Minotaurs, Trolls or any of the other Big Guys that regularly take to the Blood Bowl pitch. A Giant is subject to the following special rules:</p> <p>BASE SIZE AND TACKLE ZONES</p> <p>Unlike other players, a Giant occupies not one but four squares on the pitch. A Giant will always occupy four squares; when they are standing up, when they are Prone and when they are Stunned.</p> <p>Additionally, the direction in which a Giant faces is important as, due to their immense size, a Giant's Tackle Zone does not extend to every square adjacent to the four squares they occupy. Like other players, the Tackle Zone of a Giant covers eight squares; those to the Giant's front and sides. A Giant's Tackle Zone does not extend to the four squares directly behind the Giant, as shown in the diagram below. The controlling player must make it clear to their opponent which direction the Giant is facing and where its rear lies. Whenever a Giant finishes a Move action or follows up after a Block action, they may change their facing if they wish; though if done as part of following up after a Block action, they must still be Marking the player they made the Block action against if possible.</p> <p></p> <p>Finally, should any of the four squares occupied by a Giant's base be targeted by an in-game effect (such as a spell cast by a Wizard or by the effects of a Special Plays card), the player is considered to have been hit by the effect just as any other player would be.</p> <p>MOVEMENT</p> <p>When a Giant moves it does so just like any other player, moving a number of squares equal to its Movement Allowance. A Giant may move forward, backward, to either side, or diagonally, as long as they do not enter a square occupied by another standing player (from either team).</p> <p>If any of the four squares a Giant occupies is within the Tackle Zone of an opposition player, the Giant is considered to be Marked by that player and must dodge to leave that square, just like any other player. If when dodging any part of a Giant's base moves into a square in which it is being Marked, apply a -1 modifier per player Marking them as normal.</p> <p></p> <p>STEPPING OVER PRONE OR STUNNED PLAYERS: Unlike other players, a Giant is large enough to simply step over downed players that would block the path of other players. A Giant does not need to Jump Over a Prone or Stunned player; it may instead move freely over Prone or Stunned players if it has sufficient Movement Allowance to do so.</p> <p>However, a Giant may not end its movement with any part of its base occupying a square that contains a Prone or Stunned player. Therefore, should a Giant Fall Over whilst stepping over a Prone or Stunned player, that player is pushed back one square in a direction chosen by the coach of the team the Giant belongs to, exactly as if a Push Back block dice result had been applied against them.</p> <p>SURROUNDED!: Coaches should note that, due to the large size of Giants, they may find it impossible to move through small gaps. If at any point during its movement a Giant finds one or more of the four squares its base occupies obstructed by a Standing player, it cannot move into that square.</p> <p>PUSH BACKS</p> <p>Just like any other player, a Giant must be pushed back into empty squares. If this is not possible, then the Giant is pushed into one or more occupied squares and any players that originally occupied the square or squares are chain-pushed in turn.</p> <p>PUSHED INTO THE CROWD: If any part of a Giant's base is pushed off the pitch, the player is pushed into the crowd and removed from play. In other words, it doesn't matter how big they are, a Giant cannot be half on and half off the pitch. They are either entirely on the pitch, or they are off it!</p> <p>THROWING OTHER PLAYERS</p> <p>Giants are particularly effective at throwing smaller players. When a Giant attempts to throw a team-mate, you may re-roll a Fumbled throw.</p> <p>A GIANT OBSTRUCTION</p> <p>Giants do tend to get in the way of other teams' passing plays. When a Giant interferes with a pass, it reduces any negative modifiers that would normally apply by 2.</p> <p>SCATTER</p> <p>As Giants occupy four squares rather than the usual one, the normal Random Direction template cannot be used for them. Instead, Giants use the Random Direction template shown below. To use this template, simply roll a D16 rather than a D8, re-rolling any rolls of 13 or above.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"dungeon_bowl/","title":"Dungeon Bowl","text":"<p>Welcome to Dungeon Bowl: the game of fantasy football with a twist!</p> <p>In Dungeon Bowl, you take on the role of the head coach of your own team representing one of the eight Colleges of Magic, leading your side of violent and often insane maniacs to glory within the winding and treacherous pathways of the dungeon where the game is played.

The aim of this should be to create an interesting diverse dungeon that both players will enjoy playing across. Remember, al this stage of the game, it is not yet a competition!</p> <p>Whilst players are free to make the dungeon look however they wish, and we encourage them to work together to make a balanced playing area that doesn't inherently give one player an advantage, there are a few rules that govern how the dungeon should be laid out.</p> <p>When creating the dungeon, it should contain at least four corridor pieces, at least three small rooms, at least one large room and, of course, the two End Zones - although these are not placed until the very end of creating the dungeon (more on that later).</p> <p>Whenever two Dungeon tiles are placed adjacent to each other, there should always be at least two squares connecting them. No Dungeon tiles should ever be connected by a single square - this simply wouldn't give enough room for the players to move through! Additionally, wherever two Dungeon tiles join together, place a Door token between them to show the doorway that connects the two tiles. These are always two squares wide, and should be placed as centrally as possible. It should also be noted that the doorways are always assumed to have the doors removed, and so are simply openings - the Magisterium thought traversing the dungeon would be difficult enough without having to constantly open and close doors!</p> <p></p> <p>When both players are happy with how the dungeon is laid out, the two End Zones should be placed. These should be placed as far away from each other as possible within the dungeon.</p> <p>After the dungeon has been laid out, the Chests and Portals need to be deployed.</p> <p>The Chests are always deployed first. Both coaches roll a single D6, re-rolling any ties, with the coach who rolls highest deploying the first Chest and alternating from there. Make sure players don't look inside the Chests, that way it is entirely unknown which Chest contains the ball. Chests may be deployed in any square, with the following exceptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Chests may not be deployed in either End Zone, or in a dungeon tile connected to an End Zone.</p> </li> <li> <p>Only a single Chest may be deployed in each Dungeon tile.</p> </li> </ul> <p>After the Chests have been deployed, the Portals need to be placed within the dungeon. Each Portal is numbered differently, between 1 and 6, and should be deployed in order. Starting with the coach who rolled lowest in the previous roll-off, players alternate deploying the Portals following the same restrictions as the Chest. Additionally, Portals may not be deployed within 2 squares of a Chest.</p> <p>After the dungeon has been laid out, coaches toss a coin. The winner chooses which of the two End Zones is theirs. With the dungeon deployed between them, coaches place their dugout beside their End Zone.</p> <p>Both coaches then place their teams in the dungeon and their re-roll markers onto their dugout before quickly explaining the details of their team for their opponent's benefit.</p> <p>Below are some examples of ways you could choose to lay out the dungeon. You can choose to use one of the layouts given here, or create your own using the rules on the previous page.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"dungeon_bowl/set-up/#pre-game-sequence","title":"PRE-GAME SEQUENCE","text":"<p>Once the game is set up, the pre-game sequence begins and both coaches run through the following sequence of steps:</p> <ol> <li>COIN TOSS: The coaches toss a coin, with the winner getting the first turn.</li> <li>TAKE ON JOURNEYMEN: If a team cannot field 11 players for a league game, the team temporarily takes on a number of Journeyman players.</li> <li>INDUCEMENTS: Both coaches decide if they will purchase any Inducements for the game ahead, paid for from a team's Treasury, from 'Petty Cash', or both.</li> <li>DEPLOY PLAYERS: Starting with the coach who has the first turn, coaches deploy six players from their roster within their End Zone.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"dungeon_bowl/set-up/#take-on-journeymen","title":"TAKE ON JOURNEYMEN","text":"<p>(see Take On Journeymen, pages 38 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook)</p>"},{"location":"dungeon_bowl/set-up/#inducements","title":"INDUCEMENTS","text":"<p>(see Inducements, pages 38 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook)</p>"},{"location":"dungeon_bowl/set-up/#petty-cash","title":"PETTY CASH","text":"<p>(see Petty Cash, pages 38 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook)</p>"},{"location":"dungeon_bowl/set-up/#treasury","title":"TREASURY","text":"<p>(see Treasury, pages 38 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook)</p>"},{"location":"dungeon_bowl/set-up/#common-inducements","title":"COMMON INDUCEMENTS","text":"<p>(see Common Inducements, pages 38 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook)</p>"},{"location":"dungeon_bowl/set-up/#dungeon-tile-special-rules","title":"Dungeon Tile Special Rules","text":"<p>From pitfalls and chasms to ancient crypts, and even the chance of some wandering creatures, the dungeons that the Wizards of the Old World maintain are filled with all kinds of perils and dangers.

In the early days, there were numerous accounts of games taking many hours, or even days, as the teams ran around the dungeon in circles trying to find one of the end zones. This prompted the Magisterium to come up with a solution to help make the games go that little bit quicker, and add an extra bit of uncertainty into the mix for everyone's amusement!</p> <p>What they came up with was the use of magical teleport portals. In every game of Dungeon Bowl, there are six of these mystical spells placed around the dungeon, allowing players to teleport in-between them at speed. However, once a player enters one of these portals they have no control of which of the others they will come out of!

I'm Jim Johnson, and joining me to talk about the worst kept secret in the Old World is the legendary Bob Bifford!\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Thanks, Jim. So, what's this Gutter Bowl thing all about, then? I've never heard of it before.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Really, Bob? I thought a well-travelled superstar such as yourself must have heard of Gutter Bowl - it seems right up your alley!\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Nope! Nu-uh. Never heard of it, Jim. I swear!\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Well okay, Bob, if you say so.

Move on.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Right you are, Bob! For the uninitiated, Gutter Bowl is a less structured, more reckless form of the game we know and love. It's played across the Old World, either in the mean streets, dodging buildings and market stalls as you go; or in the sewers of the undercity, where players have to brave the stench and the slop in order to score! One benefit of such games is that they manage to do without those pesky referees, who would normally want to uphold things like 'rules' and all that. None of that here, though, Bob; unless the crowd decide to take the law into their own hands!\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Sounds like a riot, Jim!\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Often quite literally, Bob! Anyway, today marks the first ever broadcast of Gutter Bowl on Cabalvision and the final of the 2501 unofficial Gutter Bowl Championship. The Mage Street Manticores, of The Manticore's Claw tavern in eastern Nuln, take on their sewer-dwelling rivals, the Under-Nuln Undertakers, in an epic clash!\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"I'm really excited for this one, Jim!

Gutter Bowl leagues are usually organised between different streets or local taverns in an area as a way to decide which of them is the best, or who has to pick up the tab from the previous night's drinking!</p> <p>The very nature of Gutter Bowl is a lawless, violent free-for-all, though even those in charge of such a league know that there must be some very loose rules that teams need to abide by to ensure that not every game descends into an all-out brawl over petty disagreements, garden border disputes and whether or not that guy in the pub looked at them funny!</p> <p>A Gutter Bowl league largely follows the same structure as a normal Blood Bowl league and much of the post-game sequence remains the same as outlined on pages 68-73 in the Blood Bowl Rulebook. However, there are a few differences to the post-game sequence which are outlined here.</p>"},{"location":"gutter_bowl/leagues/#post-match-sequence","title":"POST-MATCH SEQUENCE","text":"<p>With games of Gutter Bowl being significantly less covered than the likes of Blood Bowl games, some aspects of the post-game sequence differ slightly to show the difference in the style of the game. This ranges from the amount of winnings, the accumulation of gold pieces, and even what happens if a Gutter Bowl player impresses enough to be whisked away to the big leagues!</p> <p>WINNINGS</p> <p>Gutter Bowl may be popular, but it certainly doesn't draw in the amount of money that the likes of Blood Bowl does! Most spectators will try anything to watch the game for free, whether that be climbing on the roofs, sneaking through the crowd, or just growling at those attempting to collect money until they leave them alone! The main way that Gutter Bowl teams raise their cash is from the bookies, who are always on hand to take bets from coaches, players or anyone else who wants a flutter.</p> <p>Winnings work completely differently for games of Gutter Bowl. To determine the amount of winnings your team has earned from the bookies, follow the steps below:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Roll a D6 and multiply the result by 10,000.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add 10,000 if your team won the match.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your team scored 3 or more Touchdowns, add 10,000.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your team caused 3 or more Casualties, add 10,000.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The final number is the amount of gold pieces your team earns from the game as winnings.</p> <p>CAUSING CASUALTIES</p> <p>With games of Gutter Bowl following what are more like guidelines than actual rules, fouling is far less frowned upon than it is in the bigger  leagues. As a result, players will also gain 2 Star Player Points for causing a Casualty as a result of a Foul action.</p> <p>PLAYERS LEAVING FOR THE BIG LEAGUES</p> <p>For those that play, Gutter Bowl is very much a hobby, rather than a profession. Most players aren't paid at all, and those that are will usually be paid in pints of Bloodweiser rather than actual gold. Normally, this is because Gutter Bowl players aren't very good; if they were, they'd be off playing for one of the proper Blood Bowl teams, rather than clobbering each other around the streets for nothing more than a couple of coppers and half a bag of pork scratchings!</p> <p>That said, every now and then, some players actually do show a modicum of talent which coincides with the game they are playing being watched by a Blood Bowl team's talent scouts. Sometimes, this is a player that has dreamt of being a star but hasn't made it yet and so had to use Gutter Bowl as a way to get noticed; other times, it is a young starlet that is part of the under-23s roster of a Blood Bowl team that has been sent to the streets to gain vital experience and toughen up; and in some instances, it is just an old codger looking for a scrap, who happens to have the game of their life before being swept off to the big leagues!</p> <p>Regardless of how these players are recruited, their Gutter Bowl coaches won't be able to stop them from leaving (at least not legally!), though they will be compensated by the Blood Bowl team with a moderate sum of gold - at least, a moderate sum of gold to a team that has very little gold in comparison to a Blood Bowl franchise that could easily afford to buy the entire street twice over!</p> <p>Before step 3 of the post-game sequence (before any player advancement), there is an additional step where scouts from professional Blood Bowl teams may look to recruit any players that have shown enough promise to be given a tryout.</p> <p>After each game, roll a D6 for each player on your roster that has gained at least one Skill or characteristic improvement over the course of the league. If the roll is greater than the total number of new Skills and characteristic improvements the player has then they have not been scouted and will remain on your team. If the roll is equal to or less than the number of new Skills and characteristic improvements the player has then they have been scouted by a Blood Bowl team and are whisked off to the big leagues. As compensation, your Gutter Bowl team gains an additional 20,000 gold pieces.</p> <p>EXPENSIVE MISTAKES</p> <p>Unlike their bigger counterparts that play professionally, Gutter Bowl teams do not usually amass great sums of gold; and they certainly don't have the likes of treasurers or administrators to keep an eye on where all that gold is going! It's far more likely that a team's gold is 'looked after' by a well-meaning, but often inept, member of the team who has all the intentions of using the cash to help the team out by purchasing kits, practice balls, and anything else they need, but is far more likely to either lose some of it or be coerced by their team-mates to use it for a lengthy drinking session at the local pub!</p> <p>In a Gutter Bowl league, do not follow the rules for Expensive Mistakes as listed on page 73 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook. Instead, if a team has 100,000 gold pieces or more stored in its Treasury during this step of the post-game sequence, their head coach must roll a D6.</p> <p>On a 4+ everything is fine: the head coach has managed to prevent any of the players pinching the team's profit and has resisted the urge to blow it all on expensive top-shelf beverages in the tavern!</p> <p>On a 1-3, some money has gone 'missing' either into the pockets of those looking after it, or those entrusted to guard it have been convinced that the best way to help their team-mates is to boost their morale with Bloodweiser and Warpstone Whiskey - not that they needed much convincing, if we are honest!

The latter are often made up of: ambitious youngsters trying to catch the eye of a passing scout; veterans whose careers in the big leagues have petered out and who are looking for one last shot at glory; and some who just want to have a go at what they see their idols doing on Nuffle's sacred turf. It is also not uncommon for an established Blood Bowl team to use Gutter Bowl as a way to train their rookies and next generation of stars, to toughen them up for a career on the gridiron!</p> <p>DRAFTING A GUTTER BOWL TEAM</p> <p>If you are drafting a team purposefully to play Gutter Bowl, either as a single game or as part of a Gutter Bowl league (see page 34), there are some important things to bear in mind when compared to drafting a standard Blood Bowl team. While the majority of the drafting a team process is the same as that presented on pages 30-35 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook, there are some key differences when creating a Gutter Bowl team.</p> <ul> <li>As there is a lot less cash involved with this secretive and clandestine version of the game, a Gutter Bowl team only has a Team Draft Budget of 750,000 gold pieces from which to create their team.</li> <li>A game of Gutter Bowl is usually played with fewer players due to the fact that there is less space; players have to weave through the streets or tunnels rather than having a big open pitch to play on! As a result, a Gutter Bowl team must have a minimum of 7 permanently hired players on their starting roster.</li> <li>It should come as little surprise that Gutter Bowl teams are largely made up of poorly trained players: after all, if the players were any good, they would probably have already been snapped up by a proper Blood Bowl team! As a result, a Gutter Bowl team can only have a maximum of 5 players on their roster that are not from the Lineman position.</li> <li>Training isn't something that comes naturally to most Gutter Bowl teams; in fact, many players see the idea of practising and staying in shape as a colossal waste of time! Team re-rolls cost 100,000 gold pieces each, regardless of which team is purchasing them.</li> <li>Gutter Bowl teams barely have enough cash to pay their players, let alone any other staff! Gutter Bowl teams may not hire any Sideline Staff under any circumstances.</li> <li>Dedicated Fans are still used as normal; some crazed individuals do actually avidly follow these teams! However, as Gutter Bowl games are more of a novelty to most fans - who are mainly there for the violence rather than the game itself - each Dedicated Fan represents roughly 10 fans rather than 1,000!</li> </ul> <p>USING AN EXISTING BLOOD BOWL TEAM</p> <p>If both coaches wish to, they can use their existing Blood Bowl teams to play Gutter Bowl, in which case follow the standard rules for drafting a Blood Bowl team found on pages 30-35 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook. It is important to remember that, even though you are using an existing team, the likes of cheerleaders, assistant coaches and apothecaries are still not used in Gutter Bowl, and so will have no effect on your team.</p> <p>Gutter Bowl can be an exciting way for two existing Blood Bowl teams to play during a standard league, so long as the league commissioner allows it. They may decide to say that any friendlies are played under 'Gutter Bowl rules', or that the play-offs (or maybe part of them) are played as games of Gutter Bowl to add some variety to their league.</p>"},{"location":"gutter_bowl/rules/#rules-differences","title":"RULES DIFFERENCES","text":"<p>As we alluded to earlier, while games of Gutter Bowl largely use the rules found in the Blood Bowl Rulebook, there are a number of differences between Gutter Bowl and its bigger brother which manifest in a variety of ways.

If both coaches agree, they simply choose if they are playing on the Street pitch or the Sewer pitch (described on pages 24-27). Alternatively, coaches may opt to let Nuffle choose where the game should take place and roll a D6. On a 1-3, the game takes place on the Sewer pitch, while on a 4+ the game takes place on the Street pitch.</p> <p>During Step 2 of the pre-game sequence, use the Weather table associated with whichever pitch is being used, as described on pages 24-27.</p> <p>During Step 3 of the pre-game sequence, a team may take on Journeymen if they are unable to field 7 players rather than 11 players, and will take on Journeymen until they are able to field the minimum requirement of 7 players as normal. Apart from this, the rules for Journeymen are unchanged.</p> <p>During Step 4 of the pre-game sequence, a Gutter Bowl team may take on Inducements as normal; however, they may only take on the ones listed on pages 28-33 and may not take any of the ones listed in the Blood Bowl Rulebook.</p> <p>There are no Prayers to Nuffle in a Gutter Bowl game, and so Step 5 of the pre-game sequence is skipped entirely.</p>"},{"location":"gutter_bowl/rules/#start-of-a-drive","title":"START OF A DRIVE","text":"<p>Whenever you start a drive in a game of Gutter Bowl, there are a few key differences to the rules presented in the Blood Bowl Rulebook.</p> <p>SET-UP</p> <p>The first, and arguably most important, thing is that both teams will only set up 7 players each, rather than the usual 11; the remainder are then placed in the Reserves box as normal. Coaches may not set up more than 7 players on the pitch at the start of a drive - though they may have to set up less as the game progresses and some players find themselves nursing an injury (or worse!) in the Knocked-out or Casualty boxes!</p> <p>All the usual rules for setting up your team still apply, so a team still cannot place any players in the opposition half, must have at least three players on the Line of Scrimmage in their half, and can have no more than two players in each Wide Zone.</p> <p>THE KICK-OFF</p> <p>During the kick-off, there are a couple of small differences to be aware of in relation to the different environment that the teams are playing in. When placing the kick, a coach of the kicking team cannot nominate a square that is either on top of one of the market stalls (if playing on the Street pitch) or in one of the sewer pits (if playing on the Sewer pitch).</p> <p>If the kick deviates onto either of these features, then it will need to re-enter play: either it will bounce off the stalls and into play, or something in the sewers will help it back onto the pitch! To do this, place the Random Direction template over the ball and roll a D8. Move the ball in the direction rolled the minimum distance so that it is back on the pitch; this is where it will land.</p> <p>Additionally, if, when the kick deviates, it would leave the pitch via one of the Sidelines, it will bounce off the walls that line the pitch rather than landing in the crowd; after all, a Gutter Bowl pitch is lined with houses or sewer walls, rather than rows of cheering fans! If this situation arises, the ball will bounce off the wall in the same manner as described on page 18. As a result, a touchback is only caused if the ball leaves the pitch from the kick-off via the two short edges of the pitch at either End Zone or crosses into the kicking team's half as usual.</p> <p>KICK-OFF EVENT</p> <p>Finally, when determining the Kick-off Event, use the Kick-off Event table associated with whichever pitch is being used, as described on pages 24-25 and on pages 26-27.</p>"},{"location":"gutter_bowl/rules/#turns","title":"TURNS","text":"<p>Gutter Bowl is a hectic, fast-paced game and there is no fixed regulation time for such a chaotic affair!

At the end of each drive, roll a D6 for each player with the Secret Weapon trait that took part in the drive. On a 4+, the player gets away with their underhanded tactics and may continue to participate in the game for now; either they went unnoticed or the crowd were suitably impressed by their violent outbursts!

Make an Injury roll for the Stalling player.</p>"},{"location":"gutter_bowl/rules/#walls","title":"WALLS","text":"<p>The edges of a Gutter Bowl pitch will be lined with walls that act as a marker for how wide the playing area actually is. The two Sidelines of any Gutter Bowl pitch are walls: on the surface these will usually be buildings or brick walls, while in the undercity, they will usually be the slimy sewer walls. If you are playing on the Street pitch, then the four market stalls in the playing area will also count as walls. Either way, all walls act in the same way during the course of the game, and will impact various things such as bouncing balls and what happens when players are slammed into them!</p> <p>PASSING</p> <p>When using the Street pitch, if a player attempts to make a Pass action where the centre line of the range ruler crosses any part of one of the market stalls in between the thrower and the target square, then they must apply an additional -1 modifier to the Passing Ability test.</p> <p>If, when resolving an Inaccurate Pass or Wildly Inaccurate Pass, the ball finishes on one of the squares that are a part of a market stall it will need to re-enter play by being thrown into play by a disgruntled vendor. To do this, place the Random Direction template over the ball and roll a D8. Move the ball in the direction rolled the minimum distance so that it is back on the pitch; this is where it will land.</p> <p></p> <p>BOUNCING OFF THE WALL</p> <p>Sometimes the ball will hit the walls around the playing area, causing it to veer off in a different direction. This could be due to the ball bouncing into the wall, a player fumbling the ball next to the wall, or various other reasons.</p> <p>When the ball would hit one of the walls following a bounce, scatter or deviation from the ball on the floor, place the Throw-in template so that the Blood Bowl logo is where the ball would be if it hadn't hit the wall, and then roll a D6. The ball will be placed in the square corresponding to the roll, as determined by the Throw-in template.</p> <p>If, when using the Street pitch, the ball would bounce diagonally into one of the corners of the market stalls, then it will bounce as shown by the diagram below.</p> <p></p> <p>THROWING THE BALL AT THE WALL</p> <p>Sometimes a player will purposefully throw the ball off the wall in order to have it ricochet off to a more advantageous position, or to try a hopeful or eccentric pass to a team-mate in order to show off!</p> <p>A player that declares a Pass action may also declare that they will bounce the ball off the wall instead of passing normally. Declare which wall square the ball is being thrown at, and test for accuracy as normal. This Pass may be interfered with as normal.</p> <p>If the test for accuracy is successful, the ball will ricochet from the target square. If the test is failed, roll a D6. On a 1-3, it hits the wall square to the right of the target square; on a 4+ it hits the wall square to the left of the target square.</p> <p>The ball will then ricochet as shown in the diagrams below, depending on how it was thrown at the wall (as shown by the green arrows). It will then travel D6 squares in the direction indicated by the red arrows and, if not caught, it will bounce once from the square where it ends up. Any and all players that the ball passes over may attempt to catch the ball, in the order that the ball passes over them, counting as an inaccurate pass. Unless the ball is caught by a player on the active team, there will be a Turnover.</p> <p></p> <p>TEAM-MATES THROWN INTO THE WALL</p> <p>Throwing team-mates in the cramped streets is asking for trouble; not that it bothers the player doing the throwing, of course! There is a very real chance of thrown players hitting one of the various walls and market stalls and coming out very much second best in that exchange!</p> <p>Should a thrown player scatter into one of the walls, they risk serious injury. The player will suffer a Crash Landing as described on page 54 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook. Additionally, when making the Armour roll for a player that has hit the wall, apply an additional +1 modifier to the roll.</p> <p>PUSHED INTO THE WALL</p> <p>With walls lining the playing areas of any Gutter Bowl game, it should come as little surprise that many players will try to use them to gain a physical advantage: namely by ramming their opponents into them in order to take them out of action!</p> <p>If a player occupies a square adjacent to a wall when they would be pushed back as a result of a Block action, and there are no squares they can be pushed into, the player will be 'pushed into the wall'.</p> <p>If a player is pushed into the wall, the active coach must roll a D6 for the pushed player. On a 1-3, the player remains where they are as they simply bounce off the wall with no lasting effects. On a 4+, the player will Fall Over in the square they are in; make an Armour roll as normal.</p> <p>Note that if a player is pushed into the wall as the result of a POW!, do not roll a D6 to see if they Fall Over - they automatically Fall Over in the square they were in.</p> <p></p> <p>For example: The Dwarf Lineman has got a Push Back result against the Goblin Lineman. As all three squares behind the Goblin are a wall, a D6 is rolled. Fortunately for the Goblin, a 2 is rolled and the Goblin stays on their feet!</p> <p></p> <p>Here, this Dwarf Lineman has got a Push Back result against a different Goblin Lineman. As the two other squares behind the Goblin are occupied, they cannot be pushed there, and so they are pushed into the wall.

Move the ball in the direction rolled the minimum distance so that it is back on the pitch; this is where it will land.</p> <p></p> <p>LANDING IN THE SEWERS</p> <p>Playing games in the filthy undercity has one very obvious, and very smelly, downside: sewage. Although the sewers themselves are perfectly functional at letting the waters flow through them, they are also something of a hazard for any player that may find themselves falling into them - accidentally or not!</p> <p>Players may not normally move through squares that make up one of the sewer pits, though they may in some circumstances find themselves on one of these squares, such as during an opposing player's Block action or a Throw Team-mate Special action.</p> <p>If a player occupies a square adjacent to a sewer pit when they would be pushed back as a result of a Block action, and there are no squares they can be pushed into, the player will be pushed into the sewers. Note that if they were pushed back as part of a POW! result, this is resolved first before being pushed into the sewers.</p> <p></p> <p>For example: The Dwarf Lineman has got a Push Back result against the Goblin Lineman. As all three squares behind the Goblin are a sewer pit, they are pushed in. The Dwarf Lineman has got a Push Back result against the Goblin Lineman. As the two other squares behind the Goblin are occupied, they cannot be pushed there, and so they are also pushed into the sewer pit.</p> <p></p> <p>The Dwarf Lineman has got a Push Back result against the Goblin Lineman. As the two other squares behind the Goblin are occupied, they cannot be pushed there, and so they are also pushed into the sewer pit.</p> <p>If a player that was thrown as part of the Throw Team-mate Special action would land in a sewer pit square, they will simply land in (relative) safety and will not have an Armour roll made against them, though this will still cause a Turnover and if the player was carrying the ball, it will still be retrieved from the sewer pit as described earlier.</p> <p>If a player ends up in a sewer pit for any reason, and would land on the same square as another player in the sewer pit, place the Random Direction template over the already occupied square and roll a D8, re- rolling any results where the player cannot be placed. The player is placed in the square corresponding to the roll.</p> <p>Players in a sewer pit cannot be Activated, have no Tackle Zone and can never be Marked or chosen as the target of an action by opposition players.</p> <p>THERE'S SOMETHING IN HERE...</p> <p>At the end of each team turn, after any Stunned players have rolled over, the active coach will need to roll a D6 for each of their players that are in one of the sewer pits and consult the chart below to see what happens to them.</p> D6 EFFECT 1 \"AARRGGHH!!!\": Whatever lurks within the sewage has taken a fancy to the player and they've met a smelly end! The player is immediately removed as a Casualty. Make a Casualty roll for them. 2\u20113 \"It's all quiet down here\": The player is managing to keep their head above the rank waters, but hasn't been able to climb their way out just yet. The player remains in the sewer pit for another turn. 4+ \"Just put me down over there\": Either through an act of surprising kindness, or more likely the fact that it wants the intruding player out of its home, the sewer creature decides to remove the player from the sewage. Place the Random Direction template over the player and roll a D8. Move the player in the direction rolled the minimum distance so that it is back on the pitch; this is where the player will be placed and will be placed Standing. If there is another player already in the square where the player is supposed to be placed, then the player already occupying the square will be pushed in the same way as if they had been pushed back during a Block action and from the direction in which the player returning to the pitch is coming from. This push is resolved by the active coach. <p></p> <p>For example: The Goblin Lineman is being placed back on the pitch having rolled a 5 on the Random Direction template. However, the Halfling Hopeful is in the square where the Goblin needs to be placed. As a result, the Halfling is pushed as if the Goblin had made a Block action against them from the direction they are coming from, and the Halfling can be placed in one of three squares chosen by the active coach.</p>"},{"location":"gutter_bowl/rules/#barricades","title":"BARRICADES","text":"<p>With games of Gutter Bowl being played in areas that aren't particularly designed to have players of all shapes and sizes barrelling through them, there are often a fair amount of things that get in the way: market stalls, barrels, debris, crates of beer, you name it! Such obstacles are of little consequence to Gutter Bowl teams, and many will actually use such objects to barricade or attempt to block off certain pathways for their opposition. They can also make for good makeshift protection from any incoming fists!</p> <p>BARRICADE LOCATIONS</p> <p>Each side of a Gutter Bowl pitch has four Barricades on them, with two in each half. These always run along the lines between squares and are three squares long. The positioning of each Barricade is the same in each half. Barricades are outlined in white so that they are easy for both coaches to see.</p> <p></p> <p>MOVING OVER BARRICADES</p> <p>Barricades are tricky to move over, but not impossible with enough determination! A player may attempt to move over a Barricade in one of two ways: either Safely or Recklessly.</p> <p>If a player wishes to move over a Barricade Safely, then it will cost them an additional 2 squares of Movement to do so as they clamber their way over the debris. A player cannot move Safely over a Barricade if they do not have enough Movement remaining to do so without Rushing.</p> <p></p> <p>For example: This Human Lineman wishes to move Safely over this Barricade. They move 1 square up to the Barricade and then 1 square over the Barricade, counting it as having moved 3 squares - 1 for the actual move plus 2 for moving Safely over the Barricade. They then continue to move and have 2 squares of Movement remaining.</p> <p>If a player wishes to move over a Barricade Recklessly then it will not cost them any additional squares of Movement as they simply leap or attempt to smash through it. However, if a player moves Recklessly over a Barricade then, after moving the player into the square over the Barricade, roll a D6. On a 2+ the player may continue as normal; however, on a 1, the player immediately Falls Over.</p> <p></p> <p>For example: The first Skaven Lineman wishes to move Recklessly over the Barricade. They move over the Barricade and roll a 4, meaning they can continue as normal. Their team-mate also decides to move Recklessly over the Barricade; however, they roll a 1 and immediately Fall Over causing a Turnover!</p> <p>BLOCKING OVER BARRICADES</p> <p>Barricades offer some form of protection against being hit; either allowing a player to hide behind them, to duck an incoming tackle, or by letting a player use something to defend themselves!</p> <p>If a Block action is made over a Barricade, so that the Barricade is in between the player making the Block action and the target of the Block action, then the target of the Block action receives a bonus of +1 to their Strength characteristic before working out any Assists.</p> <p></p> <p>For example: The Skaven Lineman has declared a Block action against the Halfling Hopeful. As there is a Barricade in between the two players, the Halfling gains +1 Strength meaning only a single Block dice is rolled.</p> <p></p> <p>The Skaven Lineman has declared a Block action against the Halfling Hopeful. As the Barricade is not directly in between the two players, the Halfling receives no benefit and so two Block dice are rolled. Ouch!</p> <p>PUSHED INTO A BARRICADE</p> <p>Many Barricades are, at best, crudely put together; many of them have the likes of nails, splinters, glass, and all manner of other painful things sticking out of them that will likely hurt any player pushed into them.</p> <p>If a player occupies a square adjacent to a Barricade when they would be pushed back as a result of a Block action, and there are no squares they can be pushed into, the player will be pushed into the Barricade.</p> <p>If a player is pushed into the Barricade, the active coach must roll a D6 for the pushed player in the same way as if they had been pushed into a wall. On a 1-3 the player remains where they are as they simply bounce off with no lasting effects. On a 4+ the player will Fall Over in the square they are in; make an Armour roll as normal.</p> <p>Note that if a player is pushed into the Barricade as the result of a POW!, do not roll a D6 to see if they Fall Over - they automatically Fall Over in the square they were in.</p>"},{"location":"gutter_bowl/rules/#street-pitch","title":"STREET PITCH","text":"<p>Games of Gutter Bowl are usually played in, well, the gutters of the various streets in the Old World; in fact, it's how the game got its name.

Randomly select one Wide Zone and make an Armour roll for each player in the selected Wide Zone. If the Armour roll fails, nothing happens, and the player is unharmed. If the Armour roll is successful, make an Injury roll as normal. 3 Riot!: The fans are giddy with excitement and want to get stuck into the fray, much to the players' displeasure. Roll a D6 for each player on the pitch. On a 6, the player is immediately Placed Prone and Stunned. 4 Quick Attack: With the ball high up in the air, one player seizes the opportunity to get stuck in straight away. One player on the kicking team may immediately perform a Block action before the first team turn begins. 5 Rogue Washing Line: One of the clotheslines above the streets has come loose, and the washing has fallen onto some of the players who must untangle themselves from an array of underpants and linen before carrying on. Both coaches randomly select one of their players on the pitch. The selected players cannot be activated during their coach's next team turn. 6 \"This round is on us!\": The local tavern's business is booming with the game going on outside their door, and so has offered some free drinks to the players as a thank you. For the duration of the drive, whenever a player is KO'd immediately roll a D6. On a 4+, place the player in the Reserves box instead of the Knocked-out box. 7 Cheering Fans: The fans are completely behind their favorite team, spurring them on to get the win. Both coaches roll a D6 and add their Fan Factor to the result. The coach that rolls highest immediately gains one extra Team re-roll for the drive. If it has not been used by the end of the drive, it is lost. In the case of a tie, neither coach gains a Team re-roll. 8 Changing Weather: Make a new roll on the Street Pitch Weather table and apply that result. If the result is 'A Normal Day' as a result of the roll, the ball will scatter before landing. 9 Loose Dogs: A number of stray dogs have made their way onto the pitch and begun to cause havoc; chasing the ball, going after the players' legs, generally being a bit of a nuisance and putting the players off their game. For the duration of the drive, neither side can use any Team re-rolls when attempting to pick up the ball or when making a Block action. 10 Black Market Dealer: A concerned passing merchant has handed out some samples of his wares to the coaches in a bid to drive up sales. Each team immediately receives one free Lesser Magic Potion as described on page 29. 11 Furious Neighbor: Not every citizen is a fan of Gutter Bowl, and certainly not Mrs. Miggins at number 12 who is making her annoyance at the racket clearly known to the players! Both coaches roll a D6 and add their Fan Factor to the result. The coach that rolls lowest randomly selects one of their players on the pitch. The selected player is immediately KO'd as they receive a well-aimed flowerpot to the noggin! 12 \"The Guards are Coming!\": The noise and antics of the game have attracted some unwanted attention, specifically from the city watch who have come out in force to arrest the most obvious troublemakers. Each coach randomly selects one of their players on the pitch. They then roll a D6 for the selected player. On a 3+ the player evades the city watch and remains on the pitch; however, on a 1-2, the player is identified as a rabble-rouser and promptly arrested.

At the start of each drive while this is in effect, each coach rolls a D6. On a 5+, they may immediately set up one additional player from their Reserves box onto the pitch, following all of the usual set-up rules. Additionally, due to the smog, only Quick Passes and Short Passes may be attempted. 3 Howling Winds: There are strong winds whistling down the streets, making it difficult to pass the ball with any kind of accuracy. Any player that attempts a Pass action will suffer an additional -1 modifier. 4\u201110 A Normal Day: There is nothing of note about the weather, except perhaps that it is a little grey. It is, however, the perfect weather for a game of Gutter Bowl! 11 Sudden Downpour: The heavens have opened and drenched the players on the streets. The sudden showers have made the ground slippery and the ball difficult to keep hold of. Players suffer an additional -1 modifier when attempting to Rush or pick up the ball. 12 A Stormy Night: The combination of thunder, lightning, and torrential rain make it very difficult to play Gutter Bowl, and there is always the risk of a stray bolt striking the streets.

Players that are set up on the Line of Scrimmage are pushed into the square directly behind them. If there is another player in the square they are being pushed to, that player is also pushed into the square directly behind them, and so on. 5 Bats!: The kick has angered a family of bats that were snoozing on the sewer roof and are about to enact some vengeance on the players on the pitch. Both coaches roll a D6. The coach that rolls lowest randomly selects one of their players on the pitch. The selected player is immediately Placed Prone and Stunned. 6 \"Get Ready, Lads!\": As the kick-off happens, the defensive team takes advantage of the dim sewer lighting to gain a quick advantage and make their move.

Each team immediately receives one free Lesser Magic Potion as described on page 29. 11 'Fresh' Sewage: The latrines in the city above have all been emptied, and the waste is rushing down the sewer, with those playing risking getting showered in yesterday's lunch. Any player within 2 squares of a sewer pit is immediately Placed Prone. 12 Swarm of Rats: Sewer rats may not like the surface dwellers, but they do like how they taste; should any players stray too close to the sewer walls their toes might get 'mistaken' for a tasty treat! For the duration of the drive, whenever a player finishes their activation in a square next to a wall, roll a D6. On a 1, the player has been swarmed by rats and immediately Falls Over.

Otherwise, it's perfectly fine for playing some Gutter Bowl! 11 It's Getting Warm: The pleasant weather on the surface is also having an impact in the undercity; though without the same cooling breeze, the sewers have become hot and humid, and the players' hands are quite sweaty. Players suffer an additional -1 modifier when attempting to pick up or catch the ball. 12 Underground Heatwave: The roasting weather topside is making the sewers an oven, and with the lack of cool air flowing downwards, players are beginning to collapse in the heat.

In the world of Blood Bowl, tournaments are a common occurrence; numerous teams jockeying for position and giving blood, sweat and tears (but mainly blood!) in order to lift the glittering trophy at the end and earn the right to be called champions. Of course, this is much the same for us too (without the violence!) as there are countless tournaments and gaming weekends held worldwide where coaches come together in a duel of wits on the gridiron!</p> <p>Blood Bowl has always thrived in a Matched Play setting, as the sports-like feel of the game lends itself to being played in this way. As a result, coaches and league commissioners have been running their own tournaments and gaming weekends around the globe for many years, and they have proved to be incredibly popular. This guide is designed to help coaches organise their own Matched Play events by providing a framework for them to run their tournaments with, including: what roles and responsibilities an event will require; a code of conduct; how coaches will need to build their rosters; plus alternative event formats and optional special rules that Event Organisers can use in order to add that extra bit of flair to their event - after all, Blood Bowl is a chaotic game at the best of times!</p> <p>Within this Matched Play Guide you will find the following:</p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT</p> <p>Tournaments and gaming weekends should be first and- foremost, fun. The Code of Conduct presented in this guide is something we expect all coaches to follow at all times to ensure that they and their opponents always have the best time possible.</p> <p>RECOMMENDED TOURNAMENT STYLE</p> <p>Here, we present our recommended way for running tournaments, including: what roles and responsibilities are required; how coaches score Tournament Points; Tiebreakers; pairing opponents; and more.</p> <p>ROSTER AND RESULTS SHEETS</p> <p>We have also provided a roster sheet and results sheet that Event Organisers have permission to photocopy and hand out for each coach to fill in. This will make it easy for the Event Organiser to review each coach's roster and keep track of the results of each game.</p> <p>ROSTER BUILDING</p> <p>This section runs through the steps of building a team roster specifically for a tournament, including: how many gold pieces a team has to spend; how many skills a team can take and how to select them; Star Players; Inducements; and anything else that will impact roster building</p> <p>ALTERNATIVE FORMATS</p> <p>Here, we present a selection of formats that Event Organisers may wish to use instead of the standard tournament format, including team events and the ever- popular Stunty Tournament!</p> <p>ADDITIONAL RULES</p> <p>Some Event Organisers like to add their own spin to the standard format and we have presented here a number of different additional rules that they can use to add that extra bit of panache to their event; from injuries and player progression, to Gold Piece Escalation (see page 28) and more.</p>"},{"location":"matched_play/guide/#code-of-conduct","title":"CODE OF CONDUCT","text":"<p>As the old adage goes: \"It's not the winning or losing that counts, but the way you play the game!\". Blood Bowl is designed with this in mind and is intended to be played in a fun, generous manner; one where fair play, good humour and showing respect for one another are paramount. As such, we have provided a series of important principles that we expect all Blood Bowl coaches to uphold at all times. After all, the most important thing is that everyone involved has a thoroughly enjoyable time during the course of the game - that way, every bone-crunching tackle, spectacular weaving run and pinpoint pass means that little bit more!</p> <p>CARDINAL RULES</p> <ul> <li>Always be polite and respectful to your opponent at all times.</li> <li>Always tell the truth and never cheat.</li> </ul> <p>IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES</p> <ul> <li>Make a respectful gesture to your opponent before the game begins, such as wishing them good luck, i offering a handshake, etc.</li> <li>Avoid using language that your opponent or those around you may find  offensive.</li> <li>Arrive on time for your game with all of the things you need to play.</li> <li>Offer your opponent the chance to examine your team roster before the game begins.</li> <li>If your opponent has any questions or queries about your roster, you should answer them truthfully and ensure your opponent understands the answer.</li> <li>Ensure that your opponent is aware of any Inducements, or other special rules your team has, and that they know what they do.</li> <li>When counting out the number of squares a player is moving, do so carefully and accurately. You should also allow your opponent the opportunity to check any moves before you move any models if they wish.</li> <li>When rolling dice, make sure they are clearly visible to all players and allow your opponent to examine the rolls before picking up the dice.</li> <li>Always ask your opponent's permission before touching their models.</li> <li>Remind your opponent about any rules they may have forgotten to use, or they have used incorrectly, especially when doing so is to your opponent's benefit rather than your own.</li> <li>Never deliberately manipulate the amount of time a game takes in order to gain an advantage, either by playing overly quickly or by wasting time.</li> <li>Try not to distract an opponent when they are trying to concentrate and always ensure you respect their personal space.</li> <li>Never complain about your own bad luck or your opponent's good luck.</li> <li>Always be humble in victory and graceful in defeat.</li> <li>Never fix the outcome of a game for any reason.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"matched_play/guide/#recommended-tournament-style","title":"RECOMMENDED TOURNAMENT STYLE","text":"<p>Here we present you with our recommended tournament Style: one that we believe will give all players the best experience and that has been extensively playtested. It covers all manner of things such as tournament rules (as you might expect!), roles and responsibilities, scoring, Tiebreakers and more.</p> <p>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p> <p>Depending on how formal you wish your event to be, it is often a good idea to make sure everyone involved in the event is aware of what their role is and the responsibilities that go alongside it. This is important to ensure that everyone knows who to go to if there is an issue; to make sure everything runs smoothly; and, above all, that everyone has a good time playing some Blood Bowl!</p> <p>EVENT ORGANISER</p> <p>Every event will need an Event Organiser, who will be responsible for running all aspects of the tournament. It will be their job to think about such things as gaming space and equipment for the coaches; appointing any Referees and Spare Players that will be required; and generally being accessible on the day to ensure that everything goes according to plan - Nuffle permitting, of course!</p> <p>The Event Organiser is essentially in charge for the course of the event, and all participants must accept that the Event Organiser has the authority to expel or disqualify anyone found breaking the rules of the event or the Cardinal Rules of the Code of Conduct - although this should, hopefully, never have to happen. It's also the Event Organiser's job to check everyone's team rosters and to ensure that all miniatures adhere to the rules for the event. The Event Organiser can also be the Referee and/or Scorekeeper if they wish; though in larger events, it may be best to share these responsibilities around. We recommend that the Event Organiser does not participate in the actual tournament so that they are always on hand to sort out any issues that may arise throughout the day.</p> <p>REFEREE</p> <p>Much like an actual game of Blood Bowl, every event needs a Referee - though unlike in Blood Bowl, they should be listened to and never bribed! In smaller events, the Event Organiser may also take on the role of a Referee. At the start of any event, it is important to point out any Referees to the coaches so they know who to contact if they have a query. It is the Referee's job to observe the games as they are played; enforce the rules; answer any queries the coaches may have; and settle any disputes between coaches in a calm and collected manner. The Referee should have a good knowledge of the rules and easy access to the Blood Bowl Rulebook, any supplements or Spike! Journals that are in use at the event, and the latest version of the FAQ and Errata in case of any rules queries.</p> <p>A Referee's ruling is final as far as the event is concerned and all players must agree to honour the rulings of the Referee in these situations. At particularly large events, it is often sensible to have a number of Referees. In this situation, it is also a good; idea to have a Head Referee who will be in charge of the other Referees on the day. We recommend that a Referee does not participate in the event so that they are always available.</p> <p>SCOREKEEPER</p> <p>Every event will need a Scorekeeper which again, is often the Event Organiser at smaller events. It is the job of the Scorekeeper to collect the results after each round, from each game, and to rank the players. They will also be responsible for organising the pairings fdr each round, including randomly pairing opponents in the first round of the tournament. Again, we recommend that the Scorekeeper does not participate so that they can collect every result as quickly as possible.</p>"},{"location":"matched_play/guide/#tournament-rules","title":"TOURNAMENT RULES","text":"<p>All games at a Blood Bowl tournament will use the Blood Bowl Rulebook, any current supplements or Spike! Journals, and the most recent versions of the FAQ, Errata and Tier List which can be found at warhammer-community.com. All coaches are expected to abide by the following rules:</p> <p>RULESPACK</p> <p>The Event Organiser should provide a rulespack for the event, which will have all the essential information for the event in it such as the venue, what time the event starts, round timings, details about lunch (something that is very important to Halfling coaches!) and any other important information about the day.</p> <p>It should also include the full details of what coaches can expect from the tournament itself, such as: the budget of gold pieces coaches have to spend on their team roster; which publications are in use for the event; what Tiebreakers are being used; and if there are any additional rules being used throughout the tournament.</p> <p>MINIATURES</p> <p>Coaches are expected to only use official Citadel and Forge World miniatures at the event and all models must be fully built, based and painted. Coaches must use appropriate miniatures for their team. Conversions are permitted at the discretion of the Event Organiser, so long as they only include parts from official Citadel and Forge World miniatures and clearly represent what they are meant to be. You may wish to ask for any coaches wishing to use conversions to submit them to the Event Organiser before the event so they can check if they are happy with them</p> <p>CONDUCT</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, Blood Bowl is first and foremost a game and one that should be played in a friendly spirit; Nuffle wants to see good sportsmanship from the coaches, even if the players on the pitch are stomping the snot out of each other! This is especially true for tournament games, where all coaches are expected to follow the Code of Conduct at all times and treat other players, and those running the event, with respect, including during any rules disputes or times when the dice don't go their way.</p> <p>SPARE PLAYER</p> <p>It's a common occurrence that a tournament will have an odd number of coaches, which would mean that one coach would be without an opponent in each round. While this person could be given a Bye (covered on page 9), it is much more satisfying for everyone involved if they have a game to play - after all, that is why they are at the event in the first place! Because of this, we always recommend having a Spare Player at every event. This should be someone who knows how to play the game to a good standard and will provide their opponent with a fun, enthusiastic game so they are not sitting around waiting for the round to finish.</p> <p>The Spare Player should not be trying to win the event, cannot win any awards and should play each h game in an appropriate manner. We recommend that the Spare player is someone different from the Event Organiser, Referee and Scorekeeper so they can focus on mply having an awesome game of Blood Bowl with the coach they are paired against!</p> <p>COACH</p> <p>Each coach is responsible for bringing their own miniatures, dice, rulebooks, tokens, pitch and dugouts (unless the event states they will provide them), and for accepting all of the tournament's rules as depicted in the specific rulespack. Depending on how serious you want your event to be, you may wish to let the coaches know in advance that they are expected to have a decent working knowledge of the game.</p>"},{"location":"matched_play/guide/#scoring-tiebreakers","title":"SCORING &amp; TIEBREAKERS","text":"<p>GAMES</p> <p>For tournament games, we recommend setting a time limit of 2 hours and 30 minutes. This should provide plenty of time to finish the game and coaches are expected to play at a decent pace to ensure the game reaches its natural conclusion. At the end of each game, coaches will need to record the result. This includes.- who won, lost or drew; the number of Bonus Points earned; the number of touchdowns each team scored; and the number of casualties inflicted by each team. If the coaches do not finish the game before the time runs out, then play continues until the end of the current turn at which point the score at that point will become the final result.</p> <p>For tournaments, coaches will earn a number of Tournament Points depending on how they did in their games. Coaches will earn 2 Tournament Points for a win, 1 Tournament Point for a draw, and 0 Tournament Points for a loss.</p> <p>It is important that both coaches provide all of the information, including the final score and number of casualties inflicted by each team, as it is all used for the Tiebreakers to determine where each coach stands in the rankings.</p> <p>RANKING</p> <p>Coaches are ranked according to the number of Tournament Points they have: the more Tournament Points a coach has, the higher they are in the rankings.</p> <p>Where coaches are tied on the number of Tournament Points, there are a number of Tiebreakers to be used to determine who is placed higher in the rankings.</p> <p>The first Tiebreaker is the number of Bonus Points a coach has earned. Bonus Points are earned in each game for meeting the following criteria:</p> <ul> <li>Scoring 3 or more touchdowns - 1 Bonus Point</li> <li>Conceding 0 touchdowns - 1 Bonus Point</li> <li>Inflicting 3 or more Casualties (counting only those that would normally award Star Player Points) - 1 Bonus Point</li> </ul> <p>It is important that a coach records the number of Bonus Points they earn in each game, on their result sheet, so that the correct Tiebreakers can be input.</p> <p>For example: Jay beats Rob 3-1 and inflicts 2 casualties while Rob inflicts 4. Jay would score 2 Tournament Points for winning the game, while Rob would score 0. Jay would earn 1 Bonus Point as he scored 3 or more touchdowns, while Rob would also earn 1 Bonus Point for inflicting 3 or more casualties onto Jay's team.</p> <p>If coaches are still tied, the second Tiebreaker is a coaches Touchdown Difference, which is equal to the number of touchdowns they have scored across all of their games minus the number of touchdowns they have conceded across all of their games.</p> <p>For example, Jay has won three games with the scores being 2-0, 3-1 and 3-0, meaning he has a Touchdown Difference of +7. Dan has also won three games with the scores being 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2, meaning he has a Touchdown Difference of +3.</p> <p>If coaches are still tied, the third Tiebreaker is the total number of touchdowns a coach has scored across all their games, with the coach who has scored the most being higher in the rankings.</p> <p>If coaches are still tied, the fourth breaker is the total number of casualties a coach has inflicted across all their games, with the coach inflicted the most being higher in the rankings.</p> <p>Further Tiebreakers are used at the Event Organiser's discretion. These could be anything from Favourite Opponent scores, most players Sent-off (not counting those Sent-off for the Secret Weapon trait), or anything else the Event Organiser wishes; however, they should make it clear to all coaches which Tiebreakers will be used for the event in the rulespack and in what order, so that coaches know what information they will need to record on their results sheet.</p>"},{"location":"matched_play/guide/#pairings","title":"PAIRINGS","text":"<p>Event Organisers are free to use any pairing system they wish, though we would recommend using the system detailed in this guide when running your own tournaments.</p>"},{"location":"matched_play/guide/#round-1","title":"ROUND 1","text":"<p>For the first round, coaches are paired together randomly, using player numbers generated upon registration.

If a coach who has already played the Spare Player is drawn against them again, then the next lowest coach who has not already played against the Spare Player will play them instead. We would always commend that a tournament has a Spare Player, as it is far more fun for your attendees than having a Bye.</p>"},{"location":"matched_play/guide/#bye","title":"BYE","text":"<p>Sometimes you may be unable to find a suitable Spare Player for your event.

Real-world sports teams don't quit the pitch when the going gets tough, and neither should Blood Bowl teams!</p> <p>Should a player concede a game, their opponent will automatically receive a 3-0 win (unless the score at the time of conceding was better) and will receive the maximum number of Bonus Points available.

He then gives his Loren Forest Treeman Grab for 1 Skill Point, and one of his Wood Elf Linemen Wrestle for 1 Skill Point.

The individual rankings are used to pair coaches up when two teams are paired against each other (see opposite), but otherwise don't have any other impact on the event - aside from bragging rights between coaches on the same team, of course!</p> <p>The team rankings take into account the result of the team as a whole; whether they won, lost or drew.

Awards for the coach that inflicted the most Casualties on Star Players, caused the most Casualties with a Star Player, or scored the most touchdowns with a Star Player are a good idea, but many more can be included as well!</p>"},{"location":"matched_play/guide/#secret-objectives","title":"SECRET OBJECTIVES","text":"<p>One additional rule that can provide another unique event experience is the use of Secret Objectives. These are a selection of hidden agendas that a team is trying to complete over the course of the game.

At the start of the game, each coach should roll for three Secret Objectives and make a note of them, re-rolling any results that they have already rolled for this game. The three Secret Objectives that are rolled are what the coach must try to achieve over the course of the game, and each coach should write them down and place them by the side of the pitch to be revealed at the end of the game. Coaches should also not reveal what they are trying to achieve to their opponent and should not reveal if they have completed any of their Secret Objectives over the course of the game, as that takes all the mystery out of it!</p> <p>When rolling to determine Secret Objectives, roll a D16 three times consult the table opposite, re-rolling any results that you have already rolled:</p> D16 SECRET OBJECTIVE 1 Red Card: Have a player on your team Sent-off. 2 Didn't Need Them Anyway: Finish any half with at least one re-roll unused. 3 Coming Alone: Have a player on your team knock down an opposition player without having any offensive assists. 4 Fouling Frenzy: Make at least three Foul actions over the course of the game. 5 Coming Surfing: Push an opposition player into the crowd. 6 Ganging Up: Have two or more players on your team make a Block action against the same opposition player in the same team turn. 7 Whoops!: Have a player on your team Knocked Down as a result of their own Block or Blitz action. 8 Not so Fast!: Cause an opposition player to fail a Dodge roll. 9 Timely Tackle: Successfully knock down an opposition player that was carrying the ball. 10 Precision Passing: Make three successful Pass actions over the course of the game. 11 Hit 'em Hard: Knock-out or inflict a Casualty! result on two opposition players in the same team turn. 12 Just a Little Further: Have a player on your team score a touchdown after successfully Rushing into the opposition's End Zone. 13 Go Long: Make a successful Pass action that is either a Long Pass or a Long Bomb. 14 Nuffle Favors the Bold: Have a player on your team make a Block action against an opposition player that has a higher ST after assists have been calculated. 15 All According to Plan: Finish a turn after activating every eligible player without using a re-roll and without causing a Turnover. 16 Headtaker: Inflict a Casualty! result on an opposition player. <p>It is important to note that while every team is able to accomplish each of these Secret Objectives in theory, some teams will find some easier than others - you'll want to hope Nuffle gives you a favourable roll!</p>"},{"location":"matched_play/guide/#blood-bowl-events-at-warhammer-world","title":"BLOOD BOWL EVENTS AT WARHAMMER WORLD","text":"<p>Blood Bowl is incredibly popular here, at its ancestral home of Warhammer World.

True legends and pioneers of the modern sport who have excelled in multiple aspects of Nuffle's sacred game. Whether it be as a game-winning scorer of many glorious touchdowns like Griff Oberwald or Hakflem Skuttlespike, a catastrophic casualty causer such as Varag Ghoul-Chewer or Morg 'n' Thorg, or a crowd-pleasing maniac like Helmut Wulf or Akhorne the Squirrel, Star Players come in all shapes and sizes.</p> <p>The aim of an All-Star Game is to allow players to field as many of their collection of Star Players as they want, creating a unique gaming experience that couldn't be achieved in a regular Blood Bowl game or league. Not only will this result in a truly spectacular match (these are the best players around after all!), but it will also mean that Star Players that could never normally be used in the same team can take to the gridiron alongside each other as a one-off \u2013 probably to try to prove which of them is really the better player (Lord Borak, of course... \u2013 Ed).</p> <p>This is the perfect excuse for coaches to field their favourite Star Players all at the same time and see what wacky and unpredictable combinations they can come up with. It also allows seasoned coaches to try out a number of different Star Players they have been considering hiring for their own teams. That way, they can get a good feel for multiple Star Players in one go. You never know, you may find a new favourite Star Player to hire during your next league season!</p> <p>Over the next few pages we explain everything you need to know to start playing your very own All-Star Games.

Enjoy!</p>"},{"location":"spike_journal/almanac_2021/#all-star-rosters","title":"ALL-STAR ROSTERS","text":"<p>The most important thing that coaches need to sort out before they begin an All-Star Game is who gets to use which Star Players. After all, a Star Player can only play for one team at a time; they may be exceptional players but even they can't be in two places at once!</p> <p>There are two methods you can use in order to decide your All-Star rosters: the Random Method and the Drafting Method. Both are fairly simple, but each will likely give a different style of All-Star team.</p> <p>An All-Star roster may only ever have a maximum of 16 players, though coaches may decide to have fewer Star Players if they wish.</p> <p>RANDOM METHOD</p> <p>The Random Method works exactly how it sounds \u2013 completely randomly! Coaches should place the names of all the Star Players into a hat, helmet, or other suitable container, and then alternate drawing them one at a time to make up their rosters.</p> <p>Star Players that come as a pair, such as the Swift Twins or Grak &amp; Crumbleberry, should be part of the same draw \u2013 that way coaches draw both of them at the same time. If a coach draws Star Players that come as a pair, the next coach may make two draws (unless their first draw also picks a pair of Star Players) to even up the numbers.</p> <p>If a coach draws a pair of Star Players when they only have one space left on their roster, they can choose to either re-draw, or place one of their other picks back into the hat to take the pair of Star Players.</p> <p>This continues until all the Star Players have been drawn or until coaches have full rosters.</p> <p>The Random Method is more likely to produce less even teams as coaches have little to no control over the Star Players they get. If you prefer playing with the hand that is dealt, or simply want to let the almighty Nuffle determine your fate, this might be the method for you!</p> <p>DRAFTING METHOD</p> <p>The Drafting Method is more likely to result in balanced teams as coaches take it in turns to pick a Star Player that best suits their needs at the time. Coaches roll a D6 (re-rolling any ties) and the coach that rolls the highest gets the first pick in the first draft round.</p> <p>In the first draft round, the coach who has the first pick may choose any Star Player for their team. The other coach may then choose any remaining Star Player. In all subsequent draft rounds, the coach who picked second in the previous draft round gets the first pick in that draft round. This process continues until all Star Players are selected or both coaches' rosters are full.</p> <p>For example: In the first draft round Rob has the first pick, and he chooses Morg 'n' Thorg for his team. Jay then chooses Deeproot Strongbranch. In the second draft round it is Jay who has the first pick, and he selects Varag Ghoul-Chewer. Rob then chooses Mighty Zug for his team.</p> <p>Star Players that come as a pair, such as the Swift Twins or Grak &amp; Crumbleberry, must be selected together. Additionally, if a coach selects a pair of Star Players then they forego their next pick in the draft to ensure that the numbers remain evenly matched \u2013 unless the other coach also selects a pair of Star Players.</p> <p>Coaches may not select a pair of Star Players if they only have one space remaining on their roster.</p> <p>The Drafting Method is far more likely to result in closely balanced teams as coaches can tactically select the best Star Player for their team during each draft round based on the choices they have already made, and those of their opponent.</p> <p>In either selection method, all Star Players should be available to be chosen from. However, if both coaches agree then they are free to exclude any Star Players from the selection process if they wish.</p> <p>RE-ROLLS AND OTHER ALL-STAR ROSTER ELEMENTS</p> <p>As an All-Star roster is not put together using gold pieces, there are certain elements that are different from a standard game. First off, there are no assistant coaches or cheerleaders for an All-Star roster; these players are only playing together for this one game, after all! There are also no Dedicated Fans for an All-Star roster either; everyone who is in attendance simply wants to see an awesome game of Blood Bowl, and the fans will likely be cheering for both teams anyway!</p> <p>Finally, and most importantly, we have re-rolls. Both teams in an All-Star Game automatically start with three team re-rolls at the start of each half.</p>"},{"location":"spike_journal/almanac_2021/#rules-differences","title":"RULES DIFFERENCES","text":"<p>To help a game using only Star Players run smoothly, and to add to the fun of this unique type of game, there are a few rules differences between an All-Star game and a regular game of Blood Bowl.</p> <p>Here we are going to run through all of these rules changes for an All-Star game.</p> <p>PRE-GAME SEQUENCE</p> <p>As you might expect, the pre-game sequence for an All-Star game is a bit different from a standard game; mainly as most of the steps are not required.</p> <p>When playing an All-Star game only step 2, the Weather, and step 6, Determine Kicking Team, are used. As there is no Fan Factor, no Journeymen, no Inducements, and no Prayers to Nuffle (these players think they are Nuffle's gift to the sport already!), these steps are not used \u2013 allowing coaches to get playing as quickly as possible.</p> <p>LONER</p> <p>Star Players will usually all have the Loner (X+) trait. This is to represent them playing alongside a team that they may not be used to, one filled with rookie players, or simply believing themselves too skilled to warrant listening to the coach.</p> <p>In an All-Star Game, every player on the pitch is a veteran of the sport who has played for years and racked up numerous accolades. To these players, the game of Blood Bowl is second nature and, even though they may not have played together before, their skills are great enough to do so almost effortlessly.</p> <p>To represent this, in an All-Star game, all Star Players lose the Loner (X+) trait if they have it.</p> <p>STAR PLAYER POINTS</p> <p>Star Players themselves do not generate Star Player Points during a game; they already have their Skills &amp; Traits listed. As such, coaches do not need to record Star Player Points during the course of the game. Although it can be fun to keep a track of all this for fun; we're sure the players themselves would be keeping track for bragging rights anyway!</p> <p>INJURIES</p> <p>With an All-Star game being an exhibition match, if a player is removed from the pitch as a Casualty there is no need to roll to see what happens to them \u2013 they simply miss the rest of the game. Though it can be fun to see what would've happened to the player if the casualty had happened during a regular game!</p> <p>POST-GAME SEQUENCE</p> <p>As an All-Star game is simply an exhibition match, albeit a very important and lucrative one, there is no post-game sequence to go through. Simply acknowledge the result, shake hands, and discuss the game over a nice cup of tea or pint of Bloodweiser!</p>"},{"location":"spike_journal/almanac_2021/#optional-league-rules","title":"OPTIONAL LEAGUE RULES","text":"<p>LONG TERM CONTRACTS</p>"},{"location":"spike_journal/almanac_2021/#signing-on","title":"SIGNING ON","text":"<p>Contracts. The huge scrolls of paper that detail a player's commitment to a team (and filled with microscopic small print, of course!) and outlines all the perks, benefits and added little extras they receive for performing well \u2013 and, on occasion, the measures taken should they underperform. Good performances on the pitch will often result in a much more lucrative deal being struck at the end of the season as the team strives to retain the services of their very best players. Though should the player fail to live up to expectations then they may soon find themselves cut from the team and looking for a new employer before the next season kicks off!</p> <p>Star Players are no exception to this; the only real differences being the amount of gold pieces they are paid, and often the length of the contract itself. Many Star Players prefer to simply sign with a team for a single game, either to give the team a helping hand, or to have another crack against a specific opponent. These one-game contracts allow Star Players to earn plenty of gold from multiple different teams in quick succession.</p> <p>However, it is not uncommon for Star Players to sign exclusively with a specific team for an entire season, receiving a contract that they simply cannot turn down \u2013 either through the amount of gold offered, or perhaps to ensure the team keeps a particular secret, well\u2026 secret. Sometimes the chance of glory, and another trophy or accolade to add to their storied careers, is worth more than the gold promised for their services \u2013 after all, most Star Players have plenty of gold as it is!</p> <p>This section of Spike! Presents 2021 Almanac! outlines an additional way coaches can use Star Players during the course of a league, one where Star Players will sign exclusively for a certain team for the entire duration of the league. Not only will this allow for coaches to get even more use out of their favourite Star Players, but it will also allow for new rivalries to be formed and add an extra dimension to the already exciting game that is Blood Bowl!</p> <p>Over the next few pages, we outline exactly how this works, detailing how coaches go about selecting their Star Players, how this affects things such as Team Value, what happens in subsequent seasons, and any other slight rules tweaks that are needed when using these rules for hiring Star Players in your leagues.</p>"},{"location":"spike_journal/almanac_2021/#drafting-your-teams","title":"DRAFTING YOUR TEAMS","text":"<p>As with any other standard league, the first thing that each coach needs to do is draft their starting roster. This follows all the normal rules for drafting a Blood Bowl team as laid out on pages 30-35 of the Blood Bowl rulebook. Coaches have 1,000,000 gold pieces to spend on players, Sideline Staff, team re-rolls and so forth.</p> <p>Once all coaches have written and submitted their team rosters, it is time to sign some Star Players!</p> <p>SIGNING STAR PLAYERS</p> <p>At the start of the season, each team may sign a single Star Player to their roster. This does not cost any gold pieces; the cost is covered by the teams' owners and so the Star Player is essentially 'free.'</p> <p>However, as each Star Player is unique, once they have signed for a team they can only play for that team during the course of the season. As such, there needs to be a system for deciding which teams get the first chance to sign a Star Player \u2013 they can't sign for multiple teams, after all!</p> <p>After all coaches have submitted their rosters, the League Commissioner should put all the participating team names into a hat, helmet, or other suitable receptacle, and then draw them out one-by-one. Once a team has been drawn, that team's coach may choose any Star Player that is eligible to play for their team to add to their roster. Once a Star Player has been selected, they may not be chosen by another team \u2013 they have already committed themselves to a team for the entirety of the season.</p> <p>Once a Star Player has been selected by a team, that team's coach adds the Star Player to their team roster. Star Players hired in this way may never be fired from a team; the financial ramifications for a team to break their contract are far too great for them to risk terminating the contract early!</p> <p>In the unlikely event that a team cannot choose any eligible Star Players, because every Star Player that could have played for their team has already been signed to another team, a coach may select any other currently unsigned Star Player, even if they could not normally play for their team. This may result in some strange combinations of teams and Star Players, though if we are honest, gold opens many doors in the world of Blood Bowl!</p> <p>TEAM VALUE</p> <p>Although teams do not need to pay any gold pieces to sign a Star Player in this manner, they will still contribute to a team's Team Value at the start of the season. This will mean that most teams will start the season with different Team Values based on the Star Player they have signed for the season. This is normal, and will result in some coaches getting a greater choice of Inducements from the very first game.</p> <p>UNSIGNED STAR PLAYERS</p> <p>Not every Star Player will be fortunate enough to be signed for the entire season, gaining that guaranteed game-time and pay cheque. Some will have to find games in the more traditional way, signing for one-off games for teams where they are needed the most.</p> <p>Star Players that were not signed to any team are still eligible to be hired by any team as Inducements in the usual way. To make it clear to all coaches which Star Players are able to be hired as Inducements, the League Commissioner should have a list of these Star Players that is easily accessible to all coaches.</p>"},{"location":"spike_journal/almanac_2021/#rules-differences_1","title":"RULES DIFFERENCES","text":"<p>Signing Star Players in this way is rather different to the usual ways in which coaches would go about adding these famous players to their teams. As such there are a few small differences to leagues that use these optional rules for Star Players, designed for all coaches to get the best out of their favourite Star Players and the rest of their teams as well.</p> <p>INJURIES</p> <p>Star Players are all pretty wealthy, having built up large sums of gold from their playing careers, various contracts, and the many sponsorship deals they are no doubt part of. As a result, these players have access to the very best doctors, necromancers, shamans, or whatever their preferred method of medical care is, and can pay handsomely to ensure that their playing careers are not tragically cut short, or are not subjected to the likes of a sawbones or those practitioners who still believe in the healing powers of leeches...</p> <p>Should a Star Player suffer a Casualty at any point during the course of the season, they will treat any results of a Serious Injury, Lasting Injury or DEAD as Seriously Hurt instead. This means that Star Players cannot suffer Niggling Injuries, Characteristic Reductions, or be killed during the course of the season; probably due to the expert medical care or protective spells they purchase with the large amounts of gold they earn through their lucrative contracts.</p> <p>This means that Star Players will always be able to play at their best, and will not suddenly become significantly worse following a strong tackle \u2013 ensuring that coaches are always getting the most out of the Star Player they invested in at the start of the season. However, Star Players may still be forced to miss their team's next game if that tackle is particularly brutal!</p> <p>STAR PLAYER POINTS</p> <p>As normal when playing with a Star Player on your team, Star Players themselves do not gain Star Player Points like normal players do. As such, they cannot gain new Skills or characteristic improvements, or be awarded the MVP award for a game, during the course of a season.</p>"},{"location":"spike_journal/almanac_2021/#subsequent-seasons","title":"SUBSEQUENT SEASONS","text":"<p>At the end of the season, all the Star Player's contracts will expire and coaches must remove them from their respective rosters. The next step is for all coaches to re-draft their teams ready for the new season as per the rules for re-drafting teams found on pages 99-100 of the Blood Bowl rulebook. Additionally, any new coaches that wish to join the league must draft their roster as normal at this point.</p> <p>The next stage is for teams to sign a Star Player for the new season. This works slightly differently to how it did in the previous season; essentially, the lower down the league a team finished in the previous season, the earlier they get the chance to pick a Star Player for the upcoming season.</p> <p>Firstly, any new teams joining the league get the first chance to sign an eligible Star Player for their team. The order that new coaches get to sign a Star Player is determined by a random draw in the same manner as explained earlier.</p> <p>For example: Nic, Sam and Luke all wish to join an ongoing league. After drafting their teams, they each need to sign a Star Player. The League Commissioner puts their name in a hat and draws them out one at a time. Sam comes out first and chooses Morg 'n' Thorg for his Halfling team. Nic's name comes out second, so he drafts Lord Borak for his Khorn team (a fine choice! \u2013 Ed). Finally, Luke chooses Roxanna Darknail for his Dark Elf team.</p> <p>After all new teams have signed a Star Player, the existing teams now get their opportunity to sign one of the remaining Star Players. However, the order in which existing teams select a Star Player is not done at random as was done for the first season. Instead, all existing teams should be ranked according to how well they did in the previous season as if they had all been part of the same division. The team that is ranked last will get the first pick of the remaining Star Players, followed by the team that was ranked second to last, and so on until the team that was ranked highest gets the final pick.</p> <p>For example: Continuing from our previous example, it is time for the existing teams to each draft a Star Player. After collating the results from the previous season, the standings are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Jay: Necromantic Horror</li> <li>Gavin: Skaven</li> <li>Shane: Black Orc</li> <li>Xavier: Wood Elf</li> <li>Keith: Lizardmen</li> <li>James: Elven Union</li> <li>Louise: Goblin</li> <li>Steve: Imperial Nobility</li> <li>Dan: Shambling Undead</li> <li>Rob: Ogre</li> </ul> <p>After the new coaches have selected their Star Players, the next pick falls to Rob as his team finished bottom in the previous season. After Rob, it will be Dan, then Steve and so on. Rob selects Deeproot Strongbranch, Dan chooses Frank 'n' Stein, Steve drafts Mighty Zug, Louise chooses Varag Ghoul-Chewer, James takes the Swift Twins, Keith selects Zolcath the Zoat, Xavier drafts Gloriel Summerbloom, Shane takes the Black Gobbo, Gavin chooses Glart Smashrip, and finally Jay drafts Wilhelm Chaney.</p> <p>This is done to ensure that the team that won the previous season doesn't keep winning and to give all the other teams the best possible chance of evening the playing field for the upcoming season!</p> <p>A FAMILIAR FACE</p> <p>Playing with the same players week in and week out is sure to have an impact on a Star Player, making them more used to the tactics and playstyle employed by that team. As such, Star Players that sign for the same team in multiple seasons will be more accustomed to the way that team plays, and will fit in much easier.</p> <p>In subsequent seasons, if a team signs the same Star Player as it did in the previous season then that Star Player will lose the Loner (X+) trait for the duration of the season.</p>"},{"location":"spike_journal/almanac_2021/#multi-player-dungeon-bowl","title":"MULTI-PLAYER DUNGEON BOWL","text":""},{"location":"spike_journal/almanac_2021/#multi-player-mayhem","title":"MULTI-PLAYER MAYHEM","text":"<p>Dungeon Bowl is, by its very nature, a chaotic experience at the best of times!

However, this doesn't quite work for a four-player game and so a new system is needed when playing Multi-player Dungeon Bowl.</p> <p>After the board has been set up, End Zones have been placed, and each coach has deployed their starting teams, coaches need to determine the order in which they take their turns. Unlike a standard game of Dungeon Bowl, a game of Multi-player Dungeon Bowl is divided into a series of game turns.</p> <p>At the start of each game turn, each coach rolls a D6. The coach that scores the highest will have the first team turn during that game turn, followed by the other coaches depending on how high they scored. Coaches that rolled the same should re-roll to see which of them goes before the other.</p> <p>After each coach has had one team turn, the game turn comes to an end and the next one begins. The process repeats itself and all coaches roll again as described above. This may result in one team going first in one game turn, and then last in the next; or perhaps having the last turn in one game turn, and then getting the first in the next. This is fine, and is all part of the unpredictability of Multi-player Dungeon Bowl!</p> <p>For example: In the first game turn Rob rolls a 6, Jay rolls a 4, Xavier rolls a 3, and Nicolas rolls a 1. This means that for this game turn the order each coach takes their team turn is Rob, Jay, Xavier, Nicolas. In the second game turn, Rob and Xavier roll a 4, Jay rolls a 2 and Nicolas rolls a 6. As Rob and Xavier both rolled a 4, they must re-roll; this time Rob rolls a 5 and Xavier rolls a 3. This means that the order each coach takes their team turn this time is Nicolas, Rob, Xavier, Jay.</p>"},{"location":"spike_journal/almanac_2021/#offensive-and-defensive-assists","title":"OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE ASSISTS","text":"<p>Whilst all the players from all the opposition teams are considered opposition players, it is important to note that they are still not going to help each other out \u2013 after all, every team is the opposition to every other team!</p> <p>As such there is an important clarification to make in regards to both offensive and defensive assists.</p> <p>Players can only provide an offensive assist to players from their own team.

Poor Refs!</p> <p>As the ultimate arbiters on the Blood Bowl pitch, Referees have the last say when it comes to sending off misbehaving players. Here we present new rules for using Blood Bowl Referee models in your own games. Lace up your boots and prepare for kick-off!</p>"},{"location":"spike_journal/almanac_2021/#referee-rules","title":"REFEREE RULES","text":"<p>The rules presented in this article are designed to give coaches an alternative way to represent the various Referees and officials that oversee a game of Blood Bowl. If you decide to use the rules presented here, then the rules for being Sent-off for committing a Foul action (as per page 63 of the Blood Bowl rulebook) will be replaced by an alternative version found later in this article.</p> <p>CHOOSING A REF</p> <p>When using these rules, coaches will need to choose which Referee they are going to use. This should be agreed on by both players or rolled for randomly. At the end of this article, you will find rules for two unique Referees, Redkur Forgebeard and Elnos Lawkeeper, each with their own set of characteristics, Skills, Traits and special rules. However, if you wish to use a generic Referee in your game, then use the following characteristics instead:</p> Characteristic MA ST AG PA AV Referee 5 2 3+ \u2013 8+ <p>Generic Referees have no additional Skills, Traits or special rules.</p> <p>DEPLOYING THE REF</p> <p>When setting up for a Drive, the Referee is always deployed after both teams have set up but before the kick-off. The Referee is deployed in the kicking team's half and must be placed adjacent to a Sideline and as close to the Line of Scrimmage as possible. The coach of the kicking team may decide which Sideline the Referee is deployed adjacent to.</p> <p>MOVING THE REF</p> <p>The Referee will always move after both teams have taken a turn \u2013 for example, initially, the Referee would move after the receiving team and the kicking team have both had their turn 1, and then again after the receiving team and the kicking team have had their turn 2, and so on.</p> <p>When the Referee has their turn, they will try to move towards where the action is thickest. To move the Referee, place the Throw-in template over the Referee, pointing towards either Sideline or End Zone, in a direction towards the ball. Then, roll a D6 and move the Referee one square in that direction. Repeat this process a number of times equal to the Referee's MA. If the Referee would move into a square containing a player or the ball, then they do not move into that square and their turn will immediately end. The Referee will ignore all Tackle Zones when they move, and they do not have a Tackle Zone themselves.</p> <p>Referees never provide assists of any kind, and if the ball would land in the square they occupy, then it will automatically scatter from that square.</p> <p>BEING SENT-OFF</p> <p>As we mentioned earlier, being Sent-off for committing a Foul action works slightly differently when there is a Referee physically on the pitch. Essentially, a Foul action committed whilst the Referee is nearby will be much easier for them to spot. Conversely, Foul actions committed further away from the Referee will be less likely to be spotted, if noticed at all. A particularly sneaky player might be able to get away with a number of devious Fouls if the Referee is elsewhere on the pitch!</p> <p>Whenever a player makes a Foul action, they will not be Sent-off if they roll a double for the Armour roll or a double for the Injury roll. Instead, after the Foul action has been made, count the number of squares between the player committing the Foul action and the Referee, and roll a D6. The chart below states what score on the D6 will result in the player being Sent-off by the Referee. As you might expect, the closer the Foul was to the Referee, the more likely the player will be Sent-off!</p> Squares to the Referee Score to be Sent-off 1 2+ 2\u20113 3+ 4\u20115 4+ 6\u20117 5+ 8\u20119 6+ <p>If the Foul action was committed 10 or more squares away from the Referee, then the player will not be Sent-off at all \u2013 the Referee is clearly too preoccupied with what is going on around them!</p> <p>Players that are Sent-off in this manner may still Argue the Call as normal.</p> <p>BLOCKING THE REF</p> <p>Naturally, some players don't take too kindly to the Referee 'interfering' with the more violent aspects of the game. In fact, they take issue with some rulekeeper telling them who they can and can't punch, and that it's not fair to step on a downed opponent. It's not uncommon for such players to 'mistime' a tackle and instead take down the Ref, which itself often leads to an all-out brawl when the rest of the players realise there is no longer a killjoy Referee to get in the way of some proper, bone-crunching plays!</p> <p>Players from either team may declare a Block action on the Referee in the same manner as they would against an opposition player, which may result in the Referee being Stunned, KO'd or even killed! Openly blocking a Referee isn't without risk, however; a player that does so may find that the Referee hits back. Regardless, brazenly breaking the rules and putting the boot in on the Referee will undoubtedly result in a red card \u2013 if the Referee is still standing to show one, of course!</p> <p>Any player that makes a Block action, Foul action, Stab Special action or Chainsaw Attack Special action against a Referee will automatically be Sent-off if the action does not result in a Stunned, KO'd or Casualty result on the Referee. Players Sent-off in this way may never Argue the Call.</p> <p>If a Referee is pushed into the crowd, then they do not risk Injury by the Crowd like a normal player \u2013 though you should still make an Armour roll to see if the Referee is affected by the initial Block action, if required. Instead, if the Referee has not been Stunned, KO'd or removed as a Casualty, then they will re-enter the pitch from a Sideline as close to the Line of Scrimmage as possible, in a place chosen by the coach whose team did not push the Referee off the pitch. If the Referee's armour was not broken when they were pushed off the pitch, then the player that pushed them off will be Sent-off as normal. This does not apply if the Referee was pushed off the pitch as the result of a Chain Push.</p> <p>Whilst a Referee is off the pitch, Stunned, KO'd or removed as a Casualty, players cannot be Sent-off for any reason until the Referee is back on the pitch. This may even mean that players with the Secret Weapon trait are not Sent-off at the end of a drive!</p>"},{"location":"spike_journal/almanac_2021/#referee-profiles","title":"REFEREE PROFILES","text":"<p>Much like Star Players, some Referees have become synonymous with the game of Blood Bowl and can be just as well known as some players for their antics or sometimes 'questionable' refereeing style.</p> <p>Here we present the rules for two unique Referees (one Elf and one Dwarf) you can use in your games.</p> <p>Elnos Lawkeeper</p> <p></p> MA ST AG PA AV 6 2 3+ \u2013 7+ <p>Skills &amp; Traits: Dodge</p> <p>Special Rules: \"Err, I think you'll find...\" \u2013 Players that are Sent-off by Elnos Lawkeeper cannot Argue the Call under any circumstances.</p> <p>Redkur Forgebeard</p> <p></p> MA ST AG PA AV 4 3 3+ \u2013 8+ <p>Skills &amp; Traits: Block</p> <p>Special Rules: \"By the Book\" \u2013 Players that commit a Foul action suffer a -1 penalty to the D6 when rolling to see if they are Sent-off for being near Redkur Forgebeard.</p> <p>Hopefully, this article has given you some extra ways to get the most from your games of Blood Bowl and provided you with another exciting option to use in your leagues.
