## Chaos Leagues 'For the Dark Gods!'

Teams that have devoted their lives to the Dark Gods will ply their trade within the Chaos Leagues, vying for their chosen god's blessings. Such leagues are unlike the more organised competitions that take place across the Old World, and put far more emphasis on causing carnage in the name of their dark patrons – there is no point winning if the way you secure victory would displease your god!

Sending a few reporters to find out what goes on in the Northern Wastes, we encountered a more ruthless form of Blood Bowl – though clearly Nuffle doesn't have an issue with it! The Dark Gods take far more interest in the Chaos Leagues, almost as if they use these to determine bragging rights between themselves. Not that the teams mind; there are always plenty of blessings for players who go out of their way to pay homage to their chosen patron!

### The Cursed Skull Goblet

This is a variation on a standard Blood Bowl league season, as described in the **Blood Bowl rulebook**. How the league itself is organised, the number of teams in it, how many divisions there are, how many rounds are played and so forth should all be decided upon by the league commissioner based upon how many coaches wish to take part, and what is best for everyone participating. The Cursed Skull Goblet differs from a normal season, however, in a couple of key aspects.

**Open to All**

The Cursed Skull Goblet is open to all comers. Coaches participating may use any team they wish and will have the usual budget of 1,000,000 gold pieces to spend to recruit their team for the season ahead.

**Dark Patrons**

At the start of the Cursed Skull Goblet, each team must decide which of the Chaos gods they will choose as their patron for the upcoming competition. A team may choose Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, Slaanesh or Chaos Undivided to worship. A team with the 'Favoured of…' special rule must select the Chaos god they are favoured of.

Each Chaos god gives its own benefits to the teams that choose them as their patron. These benefits are listed below:

**Khorne:** If a team chooses Khorne as their patron, then each time one of their players inflicts a Casualty upon an opponent they receive 3 Star Player Points instead of 2.

**Nurgle:** If a team chooses Nurgle as their patron, then each time one of their players is KO'd, Injured or Killed, roll a D6. On a 6, the player does not suffer the effects and is instead immediately placed in the Reserves box.

**Tzeentch:** If a team chooses Tzeentch as their patron, then once per game they may change a single dice from any roll to any other result of their choice on the same dice.

**Slaanesh:** If a team chooses Slaanesh as their patron, then players on their team can attempt to Rush one more time than they normally could during their activation.

**Chaos Undivided:** If a team chooses Chaos Undivided as their patron, then each time one of their players scores a touchdown they receive 4 Star Player Points instead of 3.

### Inducements

All Inducements should be allowed in the Cursed Skull Goblet. Additionally, if the league commissioner wishes, the following new Inducement may be added:

#### 0-1 Chaos Totem 

**(50,000 Gold Pieces)** 

**Available to any team:** Some coaches will carry trinkets or tokens in reverence to the Dark Gods, and some are imbued with malevolent powers.

Once per game, at the start of any friendly team turn, the head coach of a team with a Chaos Totem can use it to pray to the Dark Gods; they then roll a D6 and consult the chart below:

| D6 | Result                                                                                               |
|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | The gods are angered by the coach's insolence, and curses the team's fortunes. The team immediately loses a team re-roll. |
| 2‑5| The gods answer the coach, bringing havoc to the opposition. Randomly select an opposition player on the pitch. The selected player is immediately Knocked Down; make an Armour roll as normal. |
| 6  | The gods decide to bestow their blessing upon the team, in their own unique way. Randomly select a friendly player on the pitch. The selected player immediately gains one of the following Mutations skills of your choice for the remainder of the game: Claws, Disturbing Presence, Horns, Iron Hard Skin, Tentacles. |

### Many Glorious Prizes!

Teams that manage to win a league in the Northern Wastes are rewarded well, which often includes gaining the boons and blessings of the Chaos gods. The top placed teams of the Cursed Skull Goblet are rewarded as follows:

**Glittering Prizes:** As usual, the teams that finish 1st, 2nd and 3rd receive gold pieces as described in the **Blood Bowl rulebook**.

**The Cursed Skull Goblet:** In addition to their cash prize, the winner will receive the coveted, if slightly menacing, Cursed Skull Goblet. As well as being able to parade this prestigious trophy around, the goblet itself seems to contain some mysterious powers that can curse opposition players. The team that holds the Cursed Skull Goblet gains the following ability at the start of each game:

At the start of each game, randomly select an opposition player. That player gains the Loner (4+) trait until the end of the game.

### Wrath of Khorne Weather Table

As part of the Chaos Leagues, home games played by those who worship Khorne will be played in stadia that are built to honour the Blood God. Skulls collected in Khorne's name are built into the playing surface, and those who perish in such playing grounds will have their skulls added to those of the fallen. As well as the morbid and gruesome collection of skulls, there is every chance that Khorne himself will be watching games played in his stadia, and perhaps even make it rain blood upon the players!

To represent the unique conditions teams must face in Khornate stadia, the following Weather table is used when playing games in such grounds.

| 2D6 | Result                                                                                                                                      |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2   | **Khorne's Fury:** Khorne has become incensed that there is not enough carnage to stem his bloodlust, and he demands more bloodshed. To fuel his rage, Khorne plants his wrath within his chosen vessels on the pitch – though it comes with a cost to the players. Randomly select two players from each team. Those players gain +1 to their Strength characteristic and the Frenzy skill until a different result is rolled on the Weather table. When a different result is rolled, these players immediately roll on the Injury table. |
| 3   | **Losing Patience:** The insufficient spilling of blood, at least in his eyes, is beginning to draw the ire of Khorne – which brings its own risks. At the end of each drive, randomly select one player on the pitch. Immediately make an Armour roll, and an Injury roll if necessary, for that player. |
| 4‑10| **All Is Calm:** Khorne is content to simply watch the game without intervening, making it perfect Blood Bowl weather.                                                              |
| 11  | **Red Mist:** A red mist descends upon the pitch, coating the players in a thin veil of blood and making visibility increasingly worse. Players making a Pass action may not perform a Long pass or a Long bomb. |
| 12  | **Crimson Downpour:** So impressed with the display of violence, Khorne causes the heavens to rain crimson down upon those on the pitch, drenching them in gallons of blood and making it slippery underfoot. Players attempting to Rush will fail on the roll of a 1 or 2. Additionally, if a player suffers a Push result from a Block, roll a D6. On the roll of a 1, the player is KO'd after the push is made. |

### Khornate Kick-off Table

To represent playing Blood Bowl under the watchful gaze of Khorne, where a game without untold carnage will only invoke the fearsome wrath of the Lord of Skulls, the following Kick-off Event table is used for all games played as part of the Cursed Skull Goblet.

| 2D6 | Result                                                                                                                          |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2   | **Ref of Khorne:** The referee clearly seems to be a devotee of Khorne and actively encourages as much violence as possible. For the duration of the drive, players from both teams cannot be Sent-off for committing a Foul action. |
| 3   | **Horrifying Howls:** The bloodcurdling howls of the servants of Khorne are enough to invoke terror in even the most steadfast of players. Both coaches roll a D6. The team that scored the lowest (or both teams in the case of a tie) randomly selects one of their players on the pitch. During each player's next turn, that player is frozen by fear and may not move, perform any actions, and does not have a Tackle Zone. |
| 4   | **Frenzied Crowd:** The fans have been whipped into a murderous frenzy, and any player that ends up pushed into the crowd is likely to be at their mercy! For the duration of the drive, whenever a player is pushed into the crowd, apply a +1 modifier to the Injury roll. |
| 5   | **High Kick:** Apply the High Kick result as normal.                                                                             |
| 6   | **Cheering Fans:** Apply the Cheering Fans result as normal.                                                                     |
| 7   | **Brilliant Coaching:** Apply the Brilliant Coaching result as normal.                                                          |
| 8   | **Changing Weather:** Make a new roll on the Wrath of Khorne Weather table and apply that result. If the result is 'All is Calm' as a result of the roll, the ball will scatter before landing. |
| 9   | **Quick Snap:** Apply the Quick Snap result as normal.                                                                          |
| 10  | **Khorne Cares Not:** To Khorne, it doesn't matter from where the blood flows, so long as it does. For the duration of the drive, if a player causes a Casualty as the result of a Secret Weapon, Foul action, or pushing an opposition player into the crowd, that player will receive 2 Star Player Points, exactly as if they had caused a Casualty by performing a Block action. |
| 11  | **Blood-crazed Fan:** The violence on the pitch is just too much for one fan who is desperate to get in on the action. Both coaches roll a D6. The team that scored the lowest (or both teams in the case of a tie) randomly selects one of their players on the pitch. That player has been attacked by the blood-crazed fan and is immediately KO'd. |
| 12  | **Blood Rage:** Wanting even more bloodshed, Khorne infuses a player on each team with his fury and watches as they unleash his wrath upon the opposition! Starting with the active team, coaches randomly select one player on their team that is Marking an opposition player. The chosen player must immediately perform a Block action against an opposition player. This will not cause a Turnover. |

### Additional Post-game Sequence Rules

## Altar of Khorne Blood Bowl Pitch

The stadia of Khornate teams are more than simply pitches to play Blood Bowl on; they are also used as altars to the Blood God where his followers will perform violent sacrifices in Khorne's name. Such stadia are adorned with skulls and emblazoned with his symbols in the hope of receiving Khorne's blessing. Should the Blood God be pleased by a team's offerings then he will rain blood down upon the pitch – though this also has the impact of making the playing surface rather slippery!

**Using the Altar of Khorne Pitch in Your Blood Bowl Games**

The Altar of Khorne pitch has two sides. One depicts the playing surface in fair weather, with all manner of skulls adorning it, while the other side depicts the playing surface after Khorne has rained blood down upon both pitch and players. If both coaches agree, the following rules can be used to represent the unusual conditions:

**Skull-Strewn Surface**: At the start of the game, all is quiet. Khorne is ready to enjoy his favourite pastime – witnessing the untold carnage of a game of Blood Bowl! The brass Khornate symbols and skulls embedded in the pitch begin to get into the heads of the players, making them feel a fury rising within them. After a player declares a Block action or Blitz action, but before any Block dice are rolled, roll a D6. On the roll of a 5+, increase the blocking player's Strength by 1 for the duration of the action.

Additionally, at the end of each drive, count up the total number of Casualties that have been caused. If the total between both teams is 3 or more, flip the pitch over to the Bloodslick side.

**Bloodslick**: Khorne is satisfied by the violence on display, showing he is pleased by such carnage by raining blood down upon the pitch. This makes the pitch treacherous, place, and a player can easily lose their footing. Whenever a player suffers the Push Back result as a result of a Block action, roll a D6. On the roll of a 1, that player is immediately Knocked Down after being pushed.

---

## Khornate Balls

**Cursed Khornate Ball**

A player that is in possession of a Cursed Khornate Ball gains the Frenzy skill whilst they are in possession of it.

**Skull Ball**

Whenever a player wishes to make a Block action or Blitz action against a player holding a Skull Ball, they must first roll a D6. On the roll of a 1, they may not target the ball carrier with the Block action or Blitz action. A player that rolled a 1 to determine if it could target the ball carrier with a Block action or Blitz action may retract its declared action in order to do something else. This will not use up a team's Blitz action for a turn if the result is a 1.
