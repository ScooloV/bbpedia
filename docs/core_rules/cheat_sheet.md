In the case of a tie, neither coach rolls on the Prayers to Nuffle table. <br />Note that if you roll a result that is currently in effect, you must re-roll it. However, if you roll a result that has been rolled previously but has since expired, there is no need to re-roll it.                 |
| **7**  | ***Brilliant Coaching:*** Both coaches roll a D6 and add the number of Assistant Coaches on their Team Draft list.

| **11** | ***Officious Ref:*** Both coaches roll a D6 and add their Fan Factor to the result. The coach that rolls the lowest randomly selects one of their players from among those on the pitch. In the case of a tie. both coaches randomly select a player. Roll a D6 for the selected player(s). On a roll of 2+. the player and the referee argue and have come to blows. The player is Placed Prone and becomes Stunned. On a roll of 1 however. the player is immediately Sent-off. as described on [page 63](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#foul-actions). |
| **12** | ***Pitch Invasion:*** Both coaches roll a D6 and add their Fan Factor to the result. The coach that rolls the lowest randomly selects D3 of their players from among those on the pitch.

All of the randomly selected players are Placed Prone and become Stunned.                                                                                                                                   |

## PLAYER ACTIVATIONS

During your team turn, you may activate each Standing and/or Prone player to perform one action available to them. Players that begin their team turn Stunned cannot be activated.

### MOVE

Any player on the active team that is not Stunned can perform a simple Move action. Movement is covered in more detail on [page 44 of the Blood Bowl rulebook](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#movement).

### PASS

Once per team turn, a player on the active team may attempt to pass the ball to another square, as described on [page 48 of the Blood Bowl rulebook](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#passing-the-ball).

### HAND-OFF

Once per team turn, a player on the active team may attempt to hand the ball off to another Standing player from their team that is in an adjacent square, as described on [page 51 of the Blood Bowl rulebook](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#hand-off).

### THROW TEAM-MATE

Once per team turn, instead of performing an ordinary Pass action, a player on the active team with the 'Throw Team-mate' trait may attempt to throw a player from their team that has the 'Right Stuff' trait.
A team may not perform both a Pass action and a Throw Team-mate action during the same team turn.

### BLOCK

A Standing player on the active team can target a Standing opposition player that is within their Tackle Zone with a Block action, but cannot move before or after performing the action. Blocking is covered in more detail on [page 56 of the Blood Bowl rulebook](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#blocking).

### BLITZ

Once per team turn, a player on the active team may perform a Blitz action, an action that combines together both a Move action and a Block action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action). When a player performs a Blitz action, they may move as normal.

However, performing the Block action costs a Blitzing player one square of their Movement Allowance. The player may move both before and after performing the Block action if they wish, and may follow-up if the target of the Block action is pushed back. Movement is covered in more detail on [page 44 of the Blood Bowl rulebook](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#movement) and blocking is covered in more detail on [page 56](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#blocking).

### FOUL

Once per team turn, a player on the active team may commit a Foul action. Fouling is covered in more detail on [page 63 of the Blood Bowl rulebook](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#foul-actions).

### SPECIAL ACTIONS

In addition to these seven main actions, there are numerous Skills and Traits a player may possess that allow them to perform another, unique action. Examples include Hypnotic Gaze, which allows a player to transfix an opponent, causing them to temporarily lose their Tackle Zone so that they cannot Mark other players .

Such actions are called "Special actions" and are detailed in the appropriate Skill or Trait description. A full list of Skills, Traits and descriptions of how they work can be found on [page 74 of the Blood Bowl rulebook](../core_rules/skills_and_traits.md#skills).

## PASS ACTIONS

Once per team turn, a player on the active team may perform a Pass action in order to pass the ball to another square, as described on [page 48 of the Blood Bowl rulebook](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#passing-the-ball):

**MEASURE RANGE AND DECLARE TARGET SQUARE:** The range ruler is used to measure the range to any possible target squares before the target square is chosen and declared.

**TEST FOR ACCURACY:** The coach of the player performing the action rolls a D6 to determine the accuracy of the pass.

**PASSING INTERFERENCE:** Unless the pass was fumbled, one opposition player may be able to attempt to interfere with the pass, hoping to 'Deflect' or 'Intercept' it.

**RESOLVE PASS:** If the pass was neither fumbled nor interfered with, the pass itself is resolved!

## THROW TEAM-MATE ACTIONS

Once per team turn, instead of performing a Pass action, a player on the active team with the 'Throw Team-mate' trait can attempt to throw a team-mate with the 'Right Stuff' trait as if they were a ball, as described on [page 52 of the Blood Bowl rulebook](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#throwing-other-players):

**MEASURE RANGEAND DECLARE TARGET SQUARE:** The range ruler may be used to determine the range between the throwing player and any possible target squares, before the target square is chosen and declared.

**TEST FOR QUALITY:** The coach of the player performing the action rolls a D6 to determine the quality of the throw.

**RESOLVE THROW:** Where the thrown player lands, and how easily, depends upon the quality of the throw. If the throw is fumbled, the thrown player is dropped and will bounce.

## BLOCK ACTIONS

When a Standing player is activated they can immediately nominate a single Standing opposition player that they are currently Marking and declare that they will target them with a Block action. Unlike other actions, there is no limit to how many players may perform a Block action each team turn.

### STRENGTH

When an active player performs a Block action, the first thing to do is to compare the Strength characteristic of both players, including any modifiers:

*If both players have the same Strength characteristic, after modification, one block dice is rolled.
*If one player has a higher Strength characteristic, after modification, a pool of two block dice is rolled and the coach of the stronger player selects which result to apply.
*If one player has a Strength characteristic that is more than double that of their opponent, after modification, a pool of three block dice is rolled and the coach ofthe stronger player selects which result to apply.

### ASSISTING A BLOCK

There are two types of assist that can be counted: 'offensive' and 'defensive', as described on [page 57 of the Blood Bowl rulebook](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#assisting-a-block):

*Each offensive assist counted modifies the Strength characteristic of the player performing the Block action by +1.
*Each defensive assist counted modifies the Strength characteristic of the player that is the target of the Block action by + 1.

### BLOCK DICE

Block dice feature five icons, each representing an outcome. Some of these outcomes can be modified by Skills or Traits possessed by one or both players:

#### PLAYER DOWN!

![](../media/core_rules/player_down.jpg)

The active player is immediately Knocked Down by the player they were attempting to Block!

#### BOTH DOWN

![](../media/core_rules/both_down.jpg)

Both the active player and the target of the Block action are Knocked Down by one another.

If one or both of the players has the Block skill, they may choose to ignore this result and not be Knocked Down.

#### PUSH BACK

![](../media/core_rules/push_back.jpg)

The target of the Block action is pushed back one square by the active player. The active player may follow up into the square vacated.

#### STUMBLE

![](../media/core_rules/stumble.jpg)

If the target of the Block action has and chooses to use the Dodge skill, this result becomes a Push Back. Otherwise, this result becomes a POW!, as described below.

#### POW!

![](../media/core_rules/pow.jpg)

The target of the Block action is pushed back by the active player and is then Knocked Down in the square they have been moved into. The active player may follow up into the square vacated.

## RISKING INJURY

Whenever one player is Knocked Down or Falls Over, they become Prone and risk injury. When a player is Knocked Down or Falls Over, the coach of the opposing team will make an Armour roll against that player.
Note that when a player is Placed Prone, perhaps having wrestled an opponent to the ground, there is no risk of injury and no Armour roll is made against them.

### ARMOUR ROLLS

An Armour roll is made as described on [page 29 of the Blood Bowl rulebook](../core_rules/rules_and_regulations.md#armour-rolls), by the coach of the opposing team. If the player's armour is 'broken', an Injury roll is made. If their armour is not broken, it protects them from harm.

### INJURY ROLLS

Whenever a player's armour is broken, an Injury roll is made against them. The coach of the opposing team rolls 2D6 and consults the table below:

| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2-7** | ***Stunned:*** The player immediately becomes Stunned, as described on [page 27](../core_rules/rules_and_regulations.md#prone-and-stunned-players), and is laid face-down on the pitch.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **8-9** | ***KO'd:*** The player is immediately removed from play and placed in the Knocked-out box of their team dugout. At the end of each drive, there is a chance any Knocked-out players will recover, as described on [page 66](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#end-of-drive-sequence).                                            |
| **10+** | ***Casualty!*** The player becomes a casualty and is immediately removed from play and placed in the Casualty box of their team dugout. The coach of the opposing team rolls on the Casualty table to determine exactly what has happened to the player (as follows). |

### INJURY BY THE CROWD

When a player is pushed back into the crowd or lands in the crowd, they risk Injury by the Crowd. No Armour roll is made against the player. Instead the coach of the opposing team rolls immediately on the Injury table to see what the crowd does to the player:

* If the player is Stunned, they are placed in the Reserves box.
* If the player is Knocked-out, they are placed in the Knocked-out box. They may recover as usual at the end of the drive.
* If the player becomes a Casualty, they are placed in the Casualty box. A roll is made against them on the Casualty table, as described below.
