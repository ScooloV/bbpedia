Not all Dungeon Bowl teams are equal, as much  as the teams in questions may wish to believe they are! Simply put, some teams are just better than others when you compare the quality of their  players; though this doesn't always ensure victory. Often, the Magisterium of the colleges that are fielding the weaker team will donate some extra gold to their disadvantaged team in order to give them a  helping hand. After all, paying a small sum before the game is better than losing a bet with the Magisterium of the opposing college.

## INDUCEMENTS IN DETAIL

Dungeon Bowl teams are always looking for an advantage, be it fair or otherwise, and coaches will pay all manner of shady characters to assist their team. During the pre-game sequence of a league fixture, coaches may purchase Inducements for the game ahead by spending gold awarded as Petty Cash, taken from their Treasury or both. When creating a team for exhibition play, a coach may purchase Inducements from their Team Draft Budget.

The Magisterium of the Colleges of Magic have much invested in the games, and it is not uncommon for them to take a slightly more hands-on approach to push their team towards victory. Of course, the Magisterium charge a fee for their help - nothing comes for free in Dungeon Bowl!

When a Dungeon Bowl team hires a College Wizard, they will hire the Wizard of the same type as their college team - a College of Fire team will always hire a Bright Wizard, for example. Each college's Wizard performs slightly differently, as you would expect, as they all deal in different types of magic. The rules for each of the different types of Wizard are given as follows. A College Wizard may only use their spell once Per game.

No team may purchase more than one College Wizard Inducement per game.

#### AMBER WIZARD (COLLEGE OF SEASTS)

***BESTIAL FURY:*** You may cast this spell at the start of any of your players' activations, before that player is activated. For the duration of the turn, whenever the chosen player makes a Block action, do not compare the Strength values of the chosen player and the target of the Block action. Instead, whenever the chosen player performs a Block, a pool of three block dice is rolled and the coach of the chosen player selects which result to apply.

#### AMETHYST WIZARD (COLLEGE OF DEATH)

***LIFE DRAIN:*** You may cast this spell at the start of any of your team turns, before any player is activated. Choose a player on the opposition team that is Marked by a friendly player. Immediately make an Injury roll for the opposition player.

#### BRIGHT WIZARD (COLLEGE OF FIRE)

***FIREBALL:*** You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Choose a target square anywhere in the dungeon and roll a D6 for each Standing player (from either team) that occupies either the target square or a square adjacent to it:

* On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the Fireball.
* On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the Fireball.

Any Standing players hit by the Fireball are Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Fireball, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

#### CELESTIAL WIZARD (COLLEGE OF HEAVENS)

***CHAIN LIGHTNING:*** You may cast this spell at the start of any of your team turns, before any player is activated. Choose a player on the opposition team; that player is struck by lightning. Make an Armour roll for the chosen player, and then roll a D6.

* On a 1-2, the spell ends.
* On a 3+, choose another model (friend or foe) within 2 squares that will be hit by the lightning. Make an Armour roll for this player.

If the lightning chained to another player, roll a D6 again to see if the spell chains to another player. Keep doing this until a 1-2 is rolled, or there are no players to chain the lightning to. A player can only be affected by this spell once, therefore it cannot be chained back onto a player it has already hit.

#### GOLD WIZARD (COLLEGE OF METAL)

***TRANSMUTATION:*** You may cast this spell at the start of any of your team turns, before any player is activated. Choose a player on the opposition team and roll 2D6. If the result is equal to or less than the Armour Value of the chosen player, the player collapses under the weight of their armour and is Knocked Out.

#### GREY WIZARD (COLLEGE OF SHADOW)

***SHADOWED STEP:*** You may cast this spell at the start of any of your team turns, before any player is activated. Choose a player on your team that does not have the ball. Remove the chosen player from the dungeon and place them anywhere in the dungeon within five (5) squares of where they were.

#### JADE WIZARD (COLLEGE OF LIFE)

***GRASPING VINES:*** You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated. Choose an opposition player. The chosen player is grasped by vines and cannot be activated during that team turn. Additionally, the chosen player has no Tackle Zone until the start of their next activation.

#### LIGHT WIZARD (COLLEGE OF LIGHT)

***BLINDING LIGHT:*** You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated. Until the start of your opponent's next turn, opposition players may not perform Pass actions, Hand-off actions, or assist Block actions either offensively or defensively.
