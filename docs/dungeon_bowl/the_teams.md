**COLLEGE OF
FIRE**

The Bright Wizards of the College of
Fire have always been the most hot-headed of the Magisterium; brash,
stubborn and preferring a no-nonsense approach to the game of Dungeon
Bowl. With this in mind, it should come as little surprise that the
Dungeon Bowl teams of the College of Fire primarily attract the likes of
Dwarfs and Ogres - after all, they are also known for actin quickly (if
a little rashly) rather than thinking things
through!

However, the College of Fire's unique approach to the game has led to
significant success. In fact,

their star team, the Blazing Axes, is the most decorated team in the
history of the game, having won

the coveted Dungeon Bowl trophy on no less than six occasions - a fact
that the Bright Wizards love

to remind their colleagues in other colleges of at every opportunity.
You would think that this has left

the coffers of the College of Fire in a rather healthy state,
however, the arrogance of the Bright Wizards often leads to them
making substantial wagers with the other colleges that they don't
always win!

**COLLEGE OF
SHADOW**

The College of Shadow is undoubtedly
the most mysterious of the Colleges of Magic i World. Whilst the
Magisterium of other colleges like to make themselves and their de d
ld so that they can seem more impressive, the Grey Wizards keep
themselves very much/ Wn shadows, conducting their business in
secret in order that their true motives go
undiscovered10 he

A college that doesn't question when a player comes back covered in
blood, or asks why a player has an assorted collection of knives and
poisons, is ideal for the clandestine and shadowy races of the Old
World. The Dark Elves and Skaven in particular have been drawn to the
College of Shadow for many years, using the Grey Wizards' teachings to
further their skills in the arts of stealth, speed and assassination.
This blend of techniques has also led to the College of Shadow forming
exceptional Dungeon Bowl teams; the most well known being the Umbral
Blades, who have lifted the Dungeon Bowl trophy four times - that the
rest of the Old World is aware of at
least!

**COLLEGE OF
METAL**

The Gold Wizards of the College of
Metal have long been fans of Nuffle's sacred game. So when the
Magisterium suggested settling disputes with their own unique brand of
the sport, the College of Metal were the first to form teams. The
hard-hitting nature of College of Metal teams has attracted players
that would rather put in a crunching tackle than formulate a slick
passing play, and the likes of Orcs and more aggressive, less agile,
humans are commonplace.

However, this aggressive playstyle hasn't yielded as much success for
the College of Metal as they may

have liked. The Iron Hawks have lifted the Dungeon Bowl trophy on three
occasions, though they were

the last of the colleges to actually achieve this feat. Even with their
fairly average amount of success,

the coffers of the College of Metal are always full, regardless of the
substantial size of the wagers they

lose on various games. The Magisterium
claim that this additional gold comes from the huge stores they have
built up over hundreds of years, though the prevailing theory is that
they simply create more whenever they fancy
it!

**COLLEGE
DELIGHT**

The playstyle of College of Light
Dungeon Bowl teams focuses mainly on moving the ball around the
dungeon. Ambitious passing moves, darting runs through multiple rooms,
and well- choreographed blocking plays that allow the ball carrier to
manoeuvre through the dungeon are common tactics of teams from the
College of Light. This style of game appeals to the likes of the Elven
Union and the more noble men and women of the Empire, who make up the
majority of such teams.

The College of Light has had quite a bit of success over the years;
their most dominant team, the Radiant Lions, have lifted the coveted
Dungeon Bowl trophy on no less than four occasions, and are one of
only two teams to win in two consecutive seasons. The Radiant Lions
also hold the record for the quickest victory inside the dungeon. A
game against the Black Widows lasted a grand total of five minutes and
thirty-seven seconds before the winning touchdown was scored. This was
largely put down to the fact that the Amethyst Wizards claimed not to
know the game had started, and many of the Undead players were still
being raised!

*PETAI IUNE*

**I**t should come as a surprise to no one that the teams of the
College of Death are made up of all manner of Undead players; after
all, the Amethyst Wizards are experts in the art of necromancy. Many
of the College of Death's Magisterium have learnt the art of
fleshcraft: stitching together flesh and bone to create other, larger
monstrosities for their teams.

The likes of Skeletons, Zombies, Wraiths and Ghouls are all enrolled
within the College of Death, mainly to play as part of the college's
Dungeon Bowl teams. The most well-known team from the College of Death
is the Black Widows, who have been crowned Dungeon Bowl champions a
total of three times. The compulsory inclusion of stone floors in all
dungeons came about following their triumph in the 2481 championship.
It transpired that the Amethyst Wizards had buried over two- dozen
corpses under the dungeon before the game, and then raised them during
the match to ensure they walked away with the
trophy!

**T**he Amber Wizards have always had an affinity with the wilderness
and the beasts that live there. It is for precisely this reason that
the College of Beasts counts the likes of Beastmen, Werewolves, and
all manner of bestial beings within their ranks; such creatures feel
at home amongst similar kinds. Their unique taste in players means
that the College of Beasts can field some of the most savage players
in Dungeon Bowl.

simply not ready for the sheer

**he most powerful Celestial Wizards are
masters of the heavens, able to manipulate the weather to aid their
plans and read their fortunes in the stars. Initially, the College of
Heavens was unsure of the decision to settle disputes between the
Magisterium using Dungeon Bowl; it's hard to invoke a lightning storm or
raging tempest underground! However, the College of Heavens has
attracted the likes of Lizardmen, and some Humans in search of a
meaningful existence, to their teams - which together can make a
surprisingly effective squad!**

**The Celestial Comets are the College of Heavens' most successful
team, having won the third season of the Dungeon Bowl in 2476. However,
they also hold the record for the longest time between winning the
trophy - their next triumph coming in 2498. The Celestial Wizards put
this down to a combination of the fact that Saurus can get peckish in
the middle of a game, and some of their Human team-mates seem
particularly tasty!**

 they also risk injury, meaning they may become Stunned or worse.
 Alternatively, a player may be 'Placed Prone' without risk of

 **PLACED PRONE I**

 Being Placed Prone is often a deliberate choice a player able to
 make due to a Skill they possess. At other times m-game effect, a
