Blood Bowl players are made from some pretty stern stufff and rarely do they let such trivial concerns as a bit of inclement weather stop them from taking to the pitch. Rain or shine, sleet or tornado, no matter the time of the year, excited fans are sure to find a game worth watching!

If both coaches agree, they can use one of the following tables in place of the Weather table in the *Blood Bowl* rulebook for the duration of the game. This is ideal for representing those games played at different times of the year and in different seasons, as well as those played in more extreme environments, such as the sweltering heat of the Badlands, or in the frozen chill of Norsca.

A league commissioner may also decide that an entire league season is being held at a particular time of year, or in a specific, and perhaps less hospitable, part of the world. In such cases, all games played during that league season can use one of the following tables as determined by the league commissioner to represent the overriding conditions.

If these tables are in use, any other rules that refer to the Weather table (for example, the Changing Weather result on the Kick-off Event table) refer automatically to the table that is in use, rather than the standard table in the *Blood Bowl* rulebook.

### SPRING WEATHER TABLE

With the cold months of winter a rapidly-receding memory, spring has well and truly sprung! Blood Bowl teams the world over are taking to the pitch once more, whilst the fans flocck back to the bleachers in their droves. What a wonderful time of year!

**SPRING WEATHER TABLE**

| 2D6             | RESULT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2     | ***Morning Dew:*** The pitch is dew-covered from the cold of night, making everything a little slippery. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player attempts to Rush an extra square. Additionally, apply a -1 modifier every time a player makes an Agility test to pick up the ball.                                                                          |
| 3     | ***Blossoming Flowers :*** The flowers are blooming, the tree sap is pumping and the pollen count is high, forcing the hay fever-affliccted referee to seek shelter indoors. Whilst this weather condition is in effect, players cannot be Sent-off for committing a Foul, even if they roll a natural double on either the Armour roll or the Injury roll. |
| 4‑10 | ***Perfect Conditions (well, almost):*** It's not quite warm but then again, it's not quite cold ideal weather for a game of Blood Bowl!                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 11    | ***Misty Morning:*** A haze of thick mist has descended upon the pitch, greatly reducing visibility. Players can move only a maximum of six squares, although they may still Rush as normal. Additionally, only Quick and Short pass actions can be performed.                                                                                               |
| 12    | ***High Winds:*** The winds are whistling through the stadium and the players can barely hear each other. Roll a D6 each time a player on your team wishes to use a team re-roll. On a roll of 2+, you may use a team re-roll as normal. On a 1, a team re-roll cannot be used.                                                                              |

### SUMMER WEATHER TABLE

Summer is well and truly here! The days are long, the sky blue, and absolutely everyone wants nothing more than to spend the long, hot afternoons watching a game and catching some rays! Well, some of the players aren't so keen; it is far too hot for running around!

**SUMMER WEATHER TABLE**

| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2     | ***Sweltering Heat:*** Some players faint in the unbearable heat! D3 randomly selected players from each team that are on the pitch when a drive ends are placed in the Reserves box. They must miss the next drive.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3     | ***Melting Astrogranite:*** It's not just the players that are affected by the hot weather even the pitch is melting! It might be the heat, or it might be the sticky footing, but the players are certainly struggling to move! The number of squares a player can attempt to Rush is reduced by one (to a minimum of one).                                                                            |
| 4‑10 | ***Perfect Conditions (well, almost):*** It's still hot, but not as hot as it has been lately! A (tolerably) warm, dry and slightly overcast day provides perfect conditions for Blood Bowl.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 11    | ***Blinding Rays:*** No cloud cover in the clear, blue skies and the relentless glare of the sun leaves the players squinting and shading their eyes. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player tests against their Passing Ability. Additionally, only Quick and Short pass actions can be performed.                                                                                                    |
| 12    | ***Monsoon:*** A sudden burst of torrential rain and high winds hits the pitch, making the ball slippery and erratic. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player makes an Agility test to catch or pick up the ball, or to attempt to interfere with a pass. Additionally, when the ball scatters, it moves from the square in which it was placed four times before landing, rather than the usual three. |

### AUTUMN WEATHER TABLE

The year continues to turn, the days are shortening and there is a chill in the air! The players love this time of year; the unbearable heat is gone and the fallen leaves soften their frequent falls. The fans too enjoy the crisp air, if not the bitterly cold winds!

| 2     | ***Leaf-strewn Pitch:*** Huge drifts of leaves have piled up at regular intervals across the pitch. It looks terrible, but they're soft to land on! When a player Falls Over or is Knocked Down, the coach of the opposing team must apply a -1 modifier when making an Armour roll against them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3     | ***Autumnal Chill:*** Winter is fast approaching and players are reluctant to leave the comfortable warmth of the dugout. During the End of Drive sequence, apply a -1 modifier when rolling to see if a player recovers from being KO'd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 4‑10 | ***Perfect Conditions (well, almost):*** It's not quite warm, but then again it's not quite cold ideal Blood Bowl weather! A pleasant autumn afternoon provides perfect conditions for Blood Bowl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 11    | ***Pouring Rain:*** A torrential downpour leaves the players soaked and the ball very slippery! Apply a -1 modifier every time a player makes an Agility test to catch or pick up the ball, or to attempt to interfere with a pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12    | ***Strong Winds:*** If it wasn't for the winds, it would be a lovely day. The ball does not deviate normally. Instead, after placing the kick, the coach of the kicking team rolls a D8 to determine [the direction in which the wind is blowing](#wind-direction-table). Next, place the Throw-in template over the square in which the kick was placed, with the central arrow (3-4) pointing in the direction in which the wind is blowing. The kick then deviates in a direction determined by rolling a D6 and referring to the Throw-in template. Additionally, the number of squares the ball moves is determined by rolling a D8, rather than a D6. |

### WINTER WEATHER TABLE

Winter is well and truly settled upon the land. The days are short and the nights long. Deep snow covers the pitch and continues to fall heavily from the leaden sky. Some dedicated fans would describe it as a 'winter wonderland', but most are at home, watching the magic mirror!

**WINTER WEATHER TABLE**

| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2     | ***Cold Winds:*** The fans are shivering in the stands as a viciously cold wind blows steadily down the pitch. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player tests against their Passing Ability. Players also find it harder to get motivated and get back on the pitch. Additionally, during Step 2 of the End of Drive sequence, apply a -1 modifier when rolling to see if any player in the Knocked- out box recovers. |
| 3     | ***Freezing:*** A sudden cold snap turns the ground as hard as granite (and not the 'astro' variety that players are used to). When a player Falls Over or is Knocked Down, the coach of the opposing team must apply a +1 modifier when making an Armour roll against them.                                                                                                                                          |
| 4‑10 | ***Perfect Conditions (well, almost):*** It's rather chilly and it's threatening to rain (or snow), but considering the time of year, the conditions are almost perfect for Blood Bowl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 11    | ***Heavy Snow:*** The snow is several feet deep, making it very difficult indeed to run up and punch someone! When a player performs a Block action as part of a Blitz action (but not on its own), their Strength characteristic is reduced by 1 when comparing their Strength against the Strength of the target of the Block action.                                                                              |
| 12    | ***Blizzard:*** Freezing conditions and heavy falls of snow make the footing treacherous. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player attempts to Rush an extra square. Additionally, the poor visibility means that only Quick and Short passes can be attempted.                                                                                                                                                        |

### SUBTERRANEAN WEATHER TABLE

Whilst the weather outside is frightful, the average underground stadium is no better! Playing underground often seems like a good idea, but it rarely ever is; the roof is too low, the footing too treacherous, and there's the constant threat of earthquakes and cave-ins!

| 2     | ***Bubbling up from Below:*** The players are aghast as viscous liquid begins to seep up from below. Whether this is a natural phenomenon, the result of sabotage or a dire warning that stadia have no place being built above sewage pipes, it's definittely not pleasant. All players on the pitch subtract 1 from their MA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 3     | ***Gloomy:*** The torches are in need of replacing, and the shadows are growing long. All Long pass and Long bomb Pass actions suffer an additional -1 modifier. Additionally, when a player attempts to Rush for a second or subsequent time during their activation, apply an additional -1 modifier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4‑10 | ***Perfect Conditions (well, almost):*** The light of the sun might be missing, but the conditions are almost perfect for Blood Bowl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 11    | ***Thermal Geysers:*** Vapour begins to whistle up from cracks in the ground, followed by forceful gouts of roiling steam. If a player on your team Falls Over or is Knocked Down, roll a D6. On a roll of 1, they crack open a thermal geyser. That player is immediately catapulted through the air. Immediately treat that player as being thrown (as if they had the Right Stuff trait) by another player (with the Throw Team-mate trait), and treat the quality of the throw as terrible.                                                               |
| 12    | ***Seismic Activity:*** "Uh oh was that a tremor?" Roll a D6 at the end of each team turn, adding 1 to the result for each player on the pitch with a Strength of 5 or more. On a roll of 6+, rocks tumble down from up above. Both coaches roll off. The coach that rolls the lowest randomly selects one of their players from among those on the pitch. That player is struck by a falling rock and Knocked Down. If the roll-off results in a tie, do not roll again. Instead, both coaches must randomly select a player to be struck by a falling rock. |

### PRIMORDIAL RAINFOREST WEATHER

The tropical jungles of the world are hot, humid and deeply hostile environments! The heat is ever-present and utterly exhausting for all but the fittest of players. But it's not just the heat that teams must contend with. The rain is almost constant, a near-continual deluge that can floodd a stadium in mere moments!

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2     | ***Praise the Sun Gods:*** The sun beats down upon the jungle canopy, turning the air below into a furnace and turning the ground to rock! If a player Falls Over whilst Rushing, apply a +1 modifier to the Armour roll. Additionally, apply all of the Heat Wave weather condition rules as well.                                                                                                                    |
| 3     | ***Heat Wave:*** A glorious day, but as the heat begins to rise, it becomes harder for players to push themselves. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player attempts to Rush an extra square. Players also find it harder to get motivated and get back on the pitch. Additionally, during Step 2 of the End of Drive sequence, apply a -1 modifier when rolling to see if any player in the Knocked- out box recovers. |
| 4‑10 | ***Perfect Conditions (well, almost):*** It's muggy and the mosquitos are out, but otherwise it's perfect Blood Bowl weather.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 11    | ***Jungle Showers:*** It's raining those big, fat jungle raindrops, making the ball slippery and difficult to hold. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player makes an Agility test to pick up or catch the ball, or whenever a player attempts to interfere with a pass.                                                                                                                                               |
| 12    | ***Tropical Monsoon:*** Sheets of rain pour through the tree canopy creating a wall of water, the ground becomes boggy and visibility is severely reduced. While the monsoon persists, only Quick pass or Short pass actions can be attempted and the number of squares a player can attempt to Rush is reduced by one (to a minimum of 1).                                                                            |

### GRAVEYARD WEATHER TABLE

From the desolate Howling Hills to the rural backwaters of Sylvania, the world is full of many eerie places and spooky stadia. As if it wasn't bad enough to have to play a game on a pitch covered in gravestones, matters get worse when the weather gets atmospheric!

| 2     | ***Angry Locals:*** An angry mob of locals has arrived at the stadium looking for the town Necromancer. Unable to find the fiend, they decide he's disguised himself as one of the players! Both coaches roll off. The coach that rolls the lowest randomly selects one of their players from among those on the pitch. That player is immediately removed from the pitch and placed in the Reserves box, where they will hide until the end of the game, or until this weather condition is replaced by another. If the roll-off results in a tie, do not roll again. Instead, both coaches must randomly select a player to hide from the locals. If this weather condition is rolled again, this process is repeated; the locals are nothing if not generous in their misplaced suspicion of the players! |
| 3     | ***Fog:*** A real pea-souper has descended, reducing visibility to almost nothing! While the fog persists, only Quick pass or Short pass actions can be attempted and the number of squares a player can attempt to Rush is reduced by one (to a minimum of 1). Additionally, the referee is far less likely to spot any foul play that occurs. Whilst this weather condition is in effect, players cannot be Sent-off for committing a Foul, even if they roll a natural double on either the Armour roll or the Injury roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4‑10 | ***Perfect Conditions (well, almost):*** It's a bit gloomy, and there's a strong suggestion of faint voices whispering too quietly to be heard, but otherwise it's perfect Blood Bowl weather.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 11    | ***Pouring Rain:*** A torrential downpour leaves the players soaked and the ball very slippery! Apply a -1 modifier every time a player makes an Agility test to catch or pick up the ball, or to attempt to interfere with a pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12    | ***Lightning:*** Thunder rumbles and the night sky is lit up by regular lightning strikes. At the end of every team turn, roll a D6. On a roll of 1, a single randomly selected player on the active team is struck by lightning and immediately Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by lightning, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### DESOLATE WASTELAND WEATHER TABLE

From the Badlands to the Border Princes, much of the world consists of trackless wilderness and desolate, inhospitable places where the hostile land is cheap to acquire. Perfect for building a Blood Bowl stadium on! True, there might be earthquakes and volcanoes, but if the price is right...

On a roll of 1, that player loses their balance and is Placed Prone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Whilst this weather condition is in effect, all players are considered to have the Bone Head trait representing them constantly looking skyward to avoid being struck by unexpected lumps of falling rock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12    | ***Strong Winds:*** If it wasn't for the winds, it would be a lovely day. The ball does not deviate normally. Instead, after placing the kick, the coach of the kicking team rolls a D8 to determine [the direction in which the wind is blowing](#wind-direction-table). Next, place the Throw-in template over the square in which the kick was placed, with the central arrow (3-4) pointing in the direction in which the wind is blowing. The kick then deviates in a direction determined by rolling a D6 and referring to the Throw-in template. Additionally, the number of squares the ball moves is determined by rolling a D8, rather than a D6. |

### MOUNTAINOUS WEATHER TABLE

Up in the high peaks, the air is clear and the sun is bright, the perfect location to play some Blood Bowl, right? Wrong! Assuming some flaat ground can be found, the wind blows a constant gale, the sun is blinding, and sudden snow and ice storms strike without warning! Oh well, we're here now...

Whilst this weather condition is in effect, ignore Step 2 of the Start of Drive sequence it is not possible for a kick-off to be resolved and a touchback is automatically caused instead. Additionally, whilst this weather condition is in effect, no Pass actions or Throw Team-mate actions can be performed. |

| 12    | ***Ice Storm:*** It is extremely cold, so cold in fact that it is raining literal lumps of ice! The ice on the pitch is so treacherous that none of the players are willing to hurry, no matter how much their coach shouts! Apply a -1 modifier every time a player attempts to Rush an extra square. Additionally, all players on the pitch subtract 1 from their MA.                                                                    |

Additionally, the referee has retreated indoors and isn't bothering to even pretend they're keeping an eye on the action! Whilst this weather condition is in effect, players cannot be Sent-off for committing a Foul, even if they roll a natural double on either the Armour roll or the Injury roll.                                                                              |
