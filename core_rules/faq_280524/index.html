  <h1>Lastest FAQ</h1>

<h2 id="designers-commentary-may-2024">DESIGNER'S COMMENTARY MAY 2024</h2>
<p>The following designer's commentary is intended to complement the Blood Bowl rulebook, any issues of Spike! Journal, and any supplements associated with the Second Season Edition of the game. It is presented as a series of questions and answers; the questions are based on ones that have been asked by players, and the answers are provided by the rules writing team and explain how the rules are intended to be used. The commentaries help provide a default setting for your games, but players should always feel free to discuss the rules before a game, and change things as they see fit if they both want to do so (changes like this are usually referred to as 'house rules').</p>
<h3 id="blood-bowl-rulebook">BLOOD BOWL RULEBOOK</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If both coaches have an Inducement, Skill, Trait, etc., that takes place at the end of a team turn, whose will resolve first? <strong>(p.23)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: The coach whose team turn has just taken place will resolve any Inducements, Skills, Traits, etc., that they have first, then their opponent will resolve any of theirs.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can a team use more than one team re-roll in the same team turn? <strong>(p.24)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes. Though be careful, as if you use them all early on in a half you will be facing quite a few turns without any! Remember that you can never re-roll a re-roll.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are team re-rolls that are not spent during the first half lost for the second half as it states that only spent team re-rolls are replenished and unused ones are not carried over? <strong>(p.24)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No. What this means is that a team will always start each half with their full complement of team re-rolls, and those that are not spent in the first half cannot then be saved to add on to your store of team re-rolls. A team that starts the first half with 3 team re-rolls, will also start the second half with 3 re-rolls.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a player re-rolls a single dice from a dice pool with a Skill (e.g., Brawler), can they then use a team re-roll to allow them to re-roll the other dice from the same dice pool? <strong>(p.24)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What exactly can a team re-roll be used to re-roll? <strong>(p.24)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: A team re-roll can only be used when a team is active and during its own team turn. It can be used to re-roll all the dice in a dice pool that were rolled during their team turn, including any dice pools rolled for any Skills or Traits used during that team turn. A team re-roll may not be used to re- roll the following rolls: Deviation, Scatter, Bounce, Armour, Injury, Casualty, Throw-in, Bribes, and Argue the Call.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I use a team re-roll to force an opposing coach to re-roll a dice in any circumstances? <strong>(p.24)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a player is bitten by a Vampire as a result of a failed Bloodlust roll and becomes Stunned (even if already Stunned), do they roll over and become Prone at the end of the turn in which they were Stunned, or the following turn? <strong>(p.27)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: At the end of the following turn.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a player with a PA of 1+ scores a 1 for a Passing Ability test, after modifiers have been applied, is this still an Accurate Pass? <strong>(p.29)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can a team remove a team re-roll from their roster during a league in order to lower their Team Value? <strong>(p.34)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No. Once a team re-roll has been bought it is permanent for the duration of the league.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When the Sweltering Heat result is rolled on the Weather table, is a single D3 rolled to determine the number of players from each team affected, or do both coaches roll a separate D3? <strong>(p.37)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: A single D3 is rolled and the same result is applied to each team.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a team has fewer than 11 available players for a game, are they required to take on enough Journeymen to take their team temporarily to 11 before taking other Inducements such as Star Players? <strong>(p.38)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> After purchasing Inducements, do you add the value of the Inducements to your Current Team Value (CTV) when recalculating your CTV to determine which team is the "Underdog"? <strong>(p.38)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If two teams have the same CTV, do either team gain Inducements and can either team spend gold pieces from their Treasury? <strong>(p.38)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No to both questions.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> During the Determine Kicking Team step, does the team that wins the coin toss or roll-off automatically become the kicking team, or may they choose to be either the kicking or receiving team? <strong>(p.38)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: They may choose.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a team with the Low Cost Linemen special rule is forced to take on Journeymen, does the value of the Journeymen increase the Current Team Value of the team? <strong>(p.38 &amp; 106)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do Inducements purchased at step 4 of the pre-game sequence add to a team's Current Team Value (CTV) when CTV is recalculated when working out which team is the Underdog? <strong>(p.38)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a player is Sent-off as a result of Too Many Players, can their coach Argue the Call or use a Bribe to avoid them being Sent-off? <strong>(p.40)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes, however, players that avoid being Sent-off in this manner do not stay on the pitch and will instead be placed in the Reserves box.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When a team sets up additional players on the pitch as a result of the Swarming trait, and this takes the number of players on the pitch to above 11, can players on that team be Sent-off as per the Too Many Players rule during that drive? <strong>(p.40 &amp; 87)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No. The Too Many Players rule is used when there are more players than the team is allowed on the pitch (usually 11). The Swarming trait increases the number of players that team is allowed to field by D3 for the duration of the drive so, as long as the team does not exceed the new limit, their players cannot be Sent-off for Too Many Players. If there are any players fielded above the new limit for the Swarming team, they can be Sent-off for Too Many Players as normal.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if a team cannot nominate a kicking player as all their players are either on the Line of Scrimmage or in a Wide Zone? <strong>(p.40)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: In this instance, simply nominate a player on the Line of Scrimmage instead.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If I roll a Blitz result on the Kick-off Event table, it states I am allowed to activate D3+3 Open players. Do these players need to be Open when the Kick-off event is rolled, or can I activate players that become Open during the Blitz, such as if a player pushes an opposition player away from a team-mate so that they are now Open? <strong>(p.41)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: They must be Open at the time of the Kick-off event.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> During a Blitz result on the Kick-off Event table, if a player from the receiving team is Knocked Down does this end the Blitz? <strong>(p.41)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If, during a Blitz kick-off event, a player with the Animal Savagery trait knocks down a player on their team as part of the Animal Savagery trait, will that cause the Blitz kick-off event to immediately end? <strong>(p.41 &amp; p.81)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When a Blitz result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, it states one player may perform a Blitz action and one may perform a Throw Team-mate action. Are these included in the D3+3 players that can be activated, or in addition? <strong>(p.41)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: These are included as part of the D3+3.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> During a Blitz result on the Kick-Off Event table, can I use a team re-roll? <strong>(p.41)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No. A Kick-Off Blitz isn't a team turn. It represents the kicking team springing into action ahead of the receiving team.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A: A single D3 is rolled and the same result is applied to each team.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The rules for team turns state that a team turn ends when all eligible players have been activated. However, the rules for player activations state that coaches are not obliged to activate every player. Does this mean that coaches can choose to end their team turn without activating all of their eligible players if they wish? <strong>(p.42)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can a player that performed a Special action also make a Move action before or after performing the Special action? <strong>(p.43)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No, unless the Special action in question specifically states otherwise or is performed as part of a Blitz action (if applicable). Note that some Special actions that can be used as part of a Blitz action also state that the player cannot move after performing the Special action.</strong></p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a player that wishes to Jump over another player has no Movement Allowance remaining, can they Rush to Jump over the player? If so, how many Rush rolls are required? <strong>(p.45)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes. Two Rush rolls will be required, one for each space moved. If the first Rush roll is failed, the player will Fall Over in the square they were in rather than the one they were attempting to Jump into.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What exactly is a Blitz action? <strong>(p.46)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: A Blitz action is a single declared action that comprises both a Move action and a Block action. If a player that declared a Blitz action is forced to lose its action, then it will lose the entire Blitz action.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does a player that has declared a Blitz action have to perform a Block action as part of their Blitz action, or can they choose not to? <strong>(p.46)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: They may choose not to. However, this will still use the team's Blitz action for that turn.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can a player declare a Blitz action even if they have no target in range? <strong>(p.46)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes. They must still declare a target of the Block action (even if the target is not in range), and this will still use the team's Blitz action for the turn.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When a player declares an opposition player as the target of a Blitz action, can they change their mind during the Blitz action and instead make the Block action against a different player? <strong>(p.46)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No. When a player declares a Blitz action against an opposition player, the targeted player is the only player they may perform the Block action against. They may choose not to make the Block action at all, though the team's Blitz action for the turn is still used.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can a player make a Pass action to an adjacent friendly player? <strong>(p.48)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When making a Passing Ability test, if the roll is not a natural 1, but is reduced to less than 1 after modifiers have been applied, is this an inaccurate pass or a wildly inaccurate pass? <strong>(p.49)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: This will be a wildly inaccurate pass.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If an inaccurate or wildly inaccurate pass goes out of bounds, do you roll for passing interference before or after the throw-in? If before, where do you count the ball as for the purpose of placing the range ruler to determine which players can attempt to interfere? <strong>(p. 50)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Before. When placing the range ruler to determine which players can attempt to interfere, treat the ball as occupying the last square it was over before going out of bounds.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When resolving a Throw-in, is the square which has the Blood Bowl logo from the Throw-in template on it treated as the first square along the path, or is it treated as 'square 0' and the distance is measured from that square? <strong>(p.51)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: It is treated as square 0.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a thrown player lands in an occupied square and then subsequently bounces into another occupied square, is the player that is in the new occupied square also Knocked Down? <strong>(p.54)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a player with the Mighty Blow (+X) skill makes a Block action, and chooses the Both Down result and is Knocked Down themselves, can they still apply the effects of Mighty Blow (+X)? <strong>(p.57 &amp; 80)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No, as when the Armour roll is made for the opposition player, the player with Mighty Blow (+X) is Prone and so cannot use the skill.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When a player makes a Blitz action, do they have to nominate the target of the Block action before the player is moved? <strong>(p.59)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if a player suffers a characteristic reduction as the result of an injury, but the characteristic that would be reduced is already at its minimum value? For example, a ST 1 player that suffers a Dislocated Shoulder (-1 ST). <strong>(p.61)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: If a player that suffers a characteristic reduction is already at their minimum value, it cannot be reduced further. Instead, roll again on the Lasting Injury table until a different result that can be applied is rolled.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a player with a Passing Ability of 6+ suffers a Broken Arm and has their PA reduced by 1, what happens? <strong>(p.61)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Characteristics can ever be reduced below the minimum value shown on page 28 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook, so nothing would happen.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a player is Sent-off, which happens first: using a Bribe, Argue the Call, or is the order up to the Sent-off player's coach? <strong>(p.63 &amp; 91)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Argue the Call will always happen first, followed by any Bribes (if able).</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to Argue the Call in order to use a Bribe? <strong>(p.63 &amp; 91)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No, but should the Bribe fail, you cannot then attempt to Argue the Call as the chance to do so has passed.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a coach is ejected for having rolled a 1 when attempting to Argue the Call, are they only prevented from using a Bribe Inducement for that one sending off, or for the rest of the game? <strong>(p.63 &amp; 91)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Just for that particular sending off.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> During the End of Drive Sequence, what happens first: players are Sent-off for the Secret Weapon trait, or any end of drive weather effects (such as Sweltering Heat)? <strong>(p.66)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: During the End of Drive Sequence, Secret Weapons are always Sent-off before any other effects.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you clarify what the penalties are for conceding a game? <strong>(p.67)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: If a player concedes a match, they immediately lose the game. Then, follow the procedure outlined on page 67 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook.</strong></p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> In League Play, are Infamous Coaching Staff and Infamous Sideline Staff who play in the game, such as Josef Bugman, eligible for the MVP award? <strong>(p.70 &amp; 93)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No. Though these folk might think of themselves as players, they are coaches and support staff – infamous ones at that!</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens when a player with a PA of '-' rolls an improvement to its PA? <strong>(p.71)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Either choose another listed option, or improve its PA to 6+.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a player randomly selects a characteristic improvement, and then decides they do not want to take the characteristic improvement they have rolled, they can instead take a Secondary skill. Could they instead choose a Primary skill if they wanted? <strong>(p.71)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes.</strong></p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if a player rolls a random Skill and gains one that they could take, but cannot actually use? Such as if a player with the No Hands trait gained the Catch skill. <strong>(p.74)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: In these instances, roll again until they gain a Skill they could actually use.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a player with an AV of 8+ (or worse) randomly gains the Iron Hard Skin skill, does this count as them gaining a Skill they cannot use as the Skill will have no effect? <strong>(p.74)</strong></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if a player already has the Catch skill or the Monstrous Mouth skill and randomly rolls the other Skill?  <strong>(p.75 &amp; 78)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: If a player has the Monstrous Mouth skill and subsequently rolls the Catch skill, then they should re-roll.

<hr />

Does this 'free' Foul action mean that it does not count towards the team's one Foul action per turn, or does it mean that the player can perform this action for free? <strong>(p.80)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: This means that the player may perform this action for free. This Skill cannot be used if the team has already used their Foul action for that team turn, and if used will mean that another player cannot also make a Foul action during the same team turn.</strong></p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do Skills that apply to the ball, but are not part of a Pass action (such as Fumblerooskie), also apply to a bomb? <strong>(p.83)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No, because a bomb is not a ball.</strong></p>
<hr />

<p><strong>A: No. Hypnotic Gaze is a Special action, and therefore must be declared at the start of a player's activation like all other actions (p.42). The Hypnotic Gaze Special action allows a player to move before they perform the Hypnotic Gaze Special action if they wish.</strong></p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When re-drafting a team, are a player's agent's fees (the +20,000 gold pieces per season they have played) added to the Team Draft list, or is the +20,000 gold pieces only used for initially re-hiring the player in question? <strong>(p.100)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Only for re-hiring a player in question. So, a player that is worth 50,000 gold pieces could be hired for 70,000 gold pieces from your budget in their second season, but would still be worth 50,000 gold pieces on the Team Draft list.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> When a player uses the Trickster trait, does the player being removed from the pitch and then placed again count as the player moving? <strong>(p.5)</strong></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a player uses the Trickster trait and places themselves in a square containing the ball, do they attempt to pick it up? <strong>(p.5)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No; it is a placement not a movement. As such, the ball will immediately bounce in the same manner as if the player had been pushed back.</strong></p>
